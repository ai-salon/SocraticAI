 Here is the transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: Someone?  
Speaker B: Yeah, I would.
Speaker C: Do we have a minute before we go to the bathroom?
Speaker B: Go. Put last, you know what serving lines.  
Speaker B: Hey, everyone, thanks for coming on time. This is the AI salon - who's been before? Sarah. Great. I'll start by explaining the point of this gathering and the theme we've chosen today. Then we'll introduce ourselves, make sure we know each other. 

The AI salon is conversations like this on the meaning and impact of AI. We think this is an important moment, that this technology will impact a lot. We think many people have opinions worth hearing about this and deserve to think about the future impact of AI through these conversations. 

Today we are talking about education. I hope you saw the theme and reasons you were interested. We brought us together to have a conversation on that topic. Before we start, I want to hear your name, relationship to education and AI, and a question you've been thinking about.

I'm Joshua. I've been a student, graduate student, taught undergrads and grads, facilitated courses. I'm interested in how AI can help us better self-educate and contribute to an inverse classroom dynamic.

Speaker D: I'm Chen. My whole career has been in education. I am now at a nonprofit college access program that supports students through opportunities they might not have gotten based on their background. I'm really interested in education equity and how AI can be a part of that.
  
Speaker E: I also went through formal education. Mom is an educator. For grad school I went to Educational Neuroscience, half classroom educators, half neuro researchers. It was interesting to see the distance between practice and theory. I was interested in how machines and humans learn. What brought me to California was working at an education nonprofit to help build a pathway for community college students stuck on math and stats, their number one barrier to graduation, usually not the difficulty but their emotional experience, not belonging in the classroom. So I really care about equity, getting people from nontraditional backgrounds where they need to go.
  
And I work for a hardware company. I think higher ed and K-12 are totally changing, accelerated by AI. So equity will become a much bigger problem as more weight falls on families and community. What does that look like? Alternative models?

Speaker B: Sweet.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: I'm interested in continuing education outside of traditional college structure where people are in this environment for four years. Outside of that, how can AI facilitate continued explorations into a wide variety of subjects? I've been running reading groups for almost three to four years since I graduated college. I'm always thinking about what continued engagement with new ideas looks like. Over the past couple months, I've started using chat GBT in my own education. Chat GBT is a big part of my development of these new skills. There's some level of amputation with chat GBT. When you learn, chat GBT enhances your ability to learn skills in a particular way. But it also means that I don't need to do the process of finding relevant text and connecting all the dots because this thing will do some of that work for me. So I'm interested in, is something really fundamental lost there? And if so, how might we circumvent some of those dangers?

Speaker A: I'm doing a PhD in anthropology, and as part of my PhD, I am expected to lecture and do seminars. Before I started my PhD, I did some pedagogy. I worked in schools to learn how to educate. I'm very curious in how I could use AI to help educate people better, like use it for lectures and seminars. I'm from Europe, so there's more of a German philosophical concept of character building when it comes to education, as opposed to just learning skills. 

Speaker F: I've spent lots of time in education, like most of my 20s. This stuff is so good to help you learn things because it's personalized and you can ask questions directly. I think this dialogue based learning is always more effective for both teaching and learning. I was really bad at math in high school because of bad fundamentals. I had internalized this narrative that I'm not a math person. I realized that was a self limiting belief that's common in early education, where we segment ourselves into different kinds of people. I think education is a big gatekeeper to meritocracy. Democratizing access to quality tutors and better education services is the best means by which we can achieve meritocracy, where people have an equal shot at learning and developing their potentials.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: I grew up in Siberia. I went to university here. I also spent time in different education systems around the world, and I was a tutor as well. I'm really interested in how we have a lot of talented people around the world, but we're not actually, as a society, utilizing the majority of that latent talent that exists in people. The two things that I'm really excited about are, one, the Internet and the fact that everybody, almost everybody, has access to the Internet today. That's changed very recently. And that's something that I have seen play a big role in my life, where throughout my life, I've had different times, where I've learned things at different speeds. I've almost had different approaches to learning. The Internet is the only way that I was able to actually get personalized education that fit me, because it's always there, it's always available. But the problem is that the Internet is such a huge space, and you don't often know what to do with it. Those ideas that maybe will help you unlock that next level or the subjects or the skills, you don't actually know. There are a lot of unknown unknowns. I'm really interested in how can we guide people through this path of growth, from being in the middle of nowhere, just a kid, somewhere to actually learning things and having curiosity and living a happy life. I think that language models, and AI in general can help us create that guiding force in this big sea of the Internet.

Speaker E: Hi, I'm Natalia.  

Speaker D: My dad's a professor, I've been interested in education for a while. My concern is how do we preserve critical thinking skills and synthesizing and collecting information? If you have an AI spit out the answer at you, especially for university level education. Another problem I was talking about with a friend is I currently work at Webflow. 

Speaker E: My friend has a no code mobile app platform and we can use AI to solve the cold start problem because a lot of the problems with our platforms is, it's really hard to know, but they're also used to teach the fundamentals of web programming, components of mobile apps. 

Speaker D: So you can use GPT to start you 80% from where you were. But what do you lose if you're not actually learning the principles and instead you're developing without fundamentals? Now that we've made it much easier for anyone to develop, what is the right thing you really should be teaching, not kids, but young adults?

Speaker A: I struggled in the school and college system, but I tend to learn from outside of that system. It's after schooling and college that I actually began to discover myself a lot more. Over the last five years, I've been deeply involved in the data privacy space. And right now I'm bringing together that experience and what's happening with AI to facilitate personalization, with privacy and perception of what one needs to learn or find about themselves, their interests, specifically around education. I was actually failed building a company in India for the rural market that focused on preparing students who would only come into the market with some functional skills, just road learning. It would take a long time to develop understanding about what the market really needs. What's the work culture like and how do you bring together all of this? I'm particularly interested in my personal capacity, working with youngsters, trying to help them design interesting careers in today's world. What's happening with this LLM revolution? It just throws interesting questions. What does it mean for youngsters today who's going to hire and what are they going to hire for? What are you going to learn? How do you really prepare yourself for working?

Speaker B: Cool. Chen.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Chen: Hi, everyone. I've been on the receiving end of education for a good chunk of my life. It seems not optimal - a lot of memorization and not really understanding and then forgetting. In retrospect, you look back at all I learned like three languages and forgot them all - very suboptimal. I've always been interested in how we can make education more meaningful given the time we spend on it. I work on the AI side, so I've thought about AI tutoring as a way to make it more interactive and meaningful. But AI has moved so fast now there are also negative effects like systems that automatically generate essays, breaking paradigms of education and testing. So I'm trying to understand the negative applications but also the opportunities as the skills people need change. 

Anastasia: Unlike most here, I didn't think much about changing education with AI. I just wanted an AI to give more personalized answers for my courses. But if you think about it, it could be a big change to give personalized learning to many students. 

Sanjay: Education was a game changer for me. I came from a background that didn't point to what I'm doing today. I didn't know what I'd do after college. But a master's degree changed my trajectory. Education unlocks access. I do coaching now to help those least likely to get opportunities, to increase access. I recently read California is leaving algebra out of middle schools to increase diversity. They had two choices - pull up the bottom or push down the top, and chose the easier route. AI could tailor personal learning so even those at the bottom get help to close gaps, not push down the top.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker E: Anastasia. I just graduated last month from Karpura. I'm natively from India. I'm here for a month and a half in San Francisco. I stumbled upon chat GT. One of the three critical problems we stumbled upon in our college and in our communities: There is a long tail problem even in the research community - researchers, PhD, postdocs, professors. If you are in a top university or publish in a top journal, you get top grants and resources. Many professors and students starting out don't get that impact or visibility even if they publish. There is an ecosystem creating around enabling the top percentile. 

Second, there is a bigger DSI movement in Web 3 to enable people to get more grants for uplifting lesser known or popular fields. With AI and computer science hot, they get most investments and attention, but many other fields don't get that attention, which is necessary for broader human progress. We were thinking of building and boosting better visibility by enabling people from all subdomains to showcase impact and connect with the right communities.

Speaker B: Awesome.

Speaker E: Those are two things I'm passionate about with AI education.

Speaker B: Yeah, awesome introduction. I'm recording this conversation, anonymized information may be released. What is the purpose of education and who is it for? 

Speaker D: Informal learning versus formal - structured, facilitated. The extent these buckets exist in 5-10 years is of great interest. 

Speaker F: I see two ideas on education. One is socializing people to take part in society - collaborate, understand norms, meet strangers, build trust. A big function is socializing. 

The other is getting caught up on society's complexity to participate, contribute, and push frontiers of new capacities. That's where we think of higher ed, secondary - specializing in topics built upon by others.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript:

Speaker A: Hi, I'm Jaroslav. I'm looking at education's role historically. At the base, it's survival skills for Hunter Gatherer times via informal education to contribute to the tribe. The middle layer is economic productivity once we had states. States needed people skilled in things not normally learned from family to be productive and contribute, and also to extract something from citizens. The top layer is happiness through critical thinking and reasoning skills to understand you can create and be master of your life. This is missing from much education today.  

Speaker B: Anyone else want to build on that? Jeffrey?

Speaker C: Looking from a Northern European viewpoint, Lutheran education post-Reformation was about spiritual needs - teaching kids to read the Bible - which then enabled economic productivity. In 1700s Denmark the rise of the welfare state shaped education to produce workers and citizens, homogenizing the populace. We've always had mentor-student relationships for spiritual development, but mass education meeting state needs is new. In Europe it produces nation-state citizens and workers, unlike the US.

Speaker B: Good point. 

Speaker C: Yes, it's like indoctrinating them in a sense.

Speaker D: Education has been called industrial-era to serve industrialization - classrooms to train kids like factory workers, summers off for harvesting.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript:

Speaker B: It sounds a little bit like Andrew's point of socializing people to be part of a society is a reasonable umbrella over very different kinds of, in the smaller Lutheran society, their purpose for education was to bring people into their moral framework, which was a spiritual goal. But I think we can nicely nest that under socializing people to be part of a society and the industrialized education is doing this for a very different kind of societies. Chen, I'm curious, to the extent that you as teacher and the Education institute you're part of explicitly describe the purpose of education. What do you all talk about, either explicitly or implicitly?

Speaker D: In my teacher prep programs, it really was like, let's talk about how to teach kids and the things that we have to teach them. I think everyone actually has a different definition. When you're training to be a teacher, you probably have a different definition of what education should be in terms of what the government tells us in standardized testing and the things that we have to do for our job. It really is the second component to what Andrew was saying of building the skills that they would need to find a job that works best for them. You really don't see that community or social skills that we're talking about in the first wave of how do you be a good person? You really don't see that in any government mandated thing. But, of course, as teachers, you want to embed that. So it's often a challenge for teachers to do both. 

Speaker B: Did you want to build on this?

Speaker C: I love that we're setting up this tension here between education for doing things in the world, for doing things for the society that you're part of, and then education as this spiritual exercise for oneself that tames one's mind in particular ways, maybe develops one's character, though that's even if it's not moral education, right? The process of learning on its own, even if you're not learning about morality, is somehow shaping character. That's really interesting to me, and it's interesting because I went to a college where the life of the mind was what it was about. And so it was almost like, oh, you shouldn't be thinking too much about the practical usage of the stuff that you're learning. That's like cutting against the point of what you're doing. Most of the ways that I think about how AI will affect education is in terms of how it increases our capacities for doing things in the world. And this is sort of like the theory behind most, like, continue education. It's like, I want to do something. There's something I want to do at my job. I need to learn something in order to do that. And so that learning is connected to doing. It's interesting to think about what is learning on its own and what are the virtues of that. And, yeah, I guess I'll just throw it out there. It's just like interesting tension that we're getting at.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker D: Can I respond to that? The Chinese word for education is two parts. Jiao means to teach. Yu means to nurture. It's always meant to be the transfer of knowledge and the nurturing of human being. In every higher ed institution there's this tension you're mentioning.  I think that's an interesting point. The second point was for a while. Being armchair academic is like what worked and would produce theories that drove the world. And then are we still in that world or are we fundamentally different? Including Uchicago, we're moving to ten years on. Suddenly the tiny computer science is now one of the most biggest undergrad majors in a college that says we will teach nothing practical. And how is that changing? It's very interesting. And how would AI continue to change that?

Speaker B: I wonder if one way that Yoroslav brought know this kind of Maslow's hierarchy of education, where presumably happiness is where we can get to. And you kind of articulated that, an ideal that, rather than using the word indoctrination, communicating the important problems in the world, the problem space, and giving you the ability to figure out how you relate to those important problems is a powerful source of both. In an agency, you have the capacity to discover how to relate to the world. You weren't completely left alone with no structure, and were given the tools to do something meaningful and meaningful being defined by a story around you. I don't know, I hope I'm going to move us off from this topic, that there might be a way where this tension between spiritual fulfillment and practical contribution to the world can be made in alignment when done perfectly.

Speaker A: Going off what you say, I think there's actually a dimension along which the spiritual and the practical are one and can be just placed along an axis. And that dimension is learning about the issues in the more general world, learning about the possibilities, almost like the search space of possibilities of living your life. And one thing you could do is you could learn about your spirituality. Another one is you could understand how to be practical in society, but you need to know that those things actually exist. If you've never been taught about spirituality, you might feel like a little itch in yourself, but you want to know that you can explore that path. I would really like to talk to people more about expanding of the space of possibilities in one's head. I once started a non profit, a little research program where we basically took kids from the middle of nowhere. We matched them with professors at American universities. We had some really great professors, Princeton, Yale, and they would do research together in tech related, like ML, bio law. The whole idea wasn't to teach them about that particular topic, but it was to just show them that, hey, you were like a kid from the middle of nowhere. You can actually create knowledge. Did you know that? You can create knowledge. That's actually a really interesting idea that you probably haven't heard of. And We've seen some pretty big change in people's mindsets that took me personally five, seven years to actually walk through, but they just had to experience it once to always be able to see it in the future.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Speaker B: Yeah. I know that there were some people from my high school who didn't do well and found another way that they could contribute, like an animal rescue worker, which allowed them to align better. I do want to spend more time on groundwork, but moving from the purpose of education, oh, you want to add something?

Speaker F: I thought it's important to note that education is extremely political, and always a political tool since Plato's Republic, which indoctrinates the population. The invention of nationhood ties to the invention of modern education and imagined communities we think we belong to. National narratives justify policies that may be unpopular where enacted. We had colleges of divinity for the enlightenment of a few. More commonly, trade guilds passed down a craft. Governments standardized education to break up guilds' power. Today, education is incredibly political.  

Speaker B: Relates to the point of education for the state. We see spiritual versus skills and personal versus state tensions. A question is who should we focus on regarding education? While we’ve heard of continued education for self-fulfillment, some brought up children, and formal versus informal often focuses on the young.

Speaker D: Formal education versus learning highlights the tensions. Learning meets the learner’s needs to grow. Education ties to state politics and indoctrination. That separation is important now.

Speaker B: Yeah. Anyone want to add on the who for conceptualizing education? You can deny the premise. 

Speaker E: Connecting points, humans needed mediums to be cohesive as a civilization - languages and communication. Over time, education and knowledge centralized as resources did. Today education is more democratized, though unequal access remains. Progress has brought huge changes in access.

Speaker D: Yes.
 Here is the edited transcript with the filler content removed:

```Speaker E: I think how fundamentally the incentives have been aligned for the state, the nation, the overall society. Those are more broader structural changes which can't change even in the next 200, 300 years because of the pace of civilization. So certain elements need to remain same for the society to function as a moral construct. And second, I think with more democratization, with more access, with AI coming in the leapfrog, the need for humans decreasing, we should also focus upon how the ethical discussion comes in. Is the right information reaching the right person? Is it being controlled? Is it being uncensored or not?

Speaker B: Am I hearing you right that organizations, like Harvard, become institutions with purposes beyond just education, like research and branding? While the technology that might change education is changing much faster than institutions change? 

Speaker E: That's one point. And second is the broader democratization we can have with technology or the information we can access. Earlier information was much more controlled, concentrated, limited by nations, boundaries, book availability.  

Speaker B: Let's poll - do people think AI technology in education will weaken formal structures?

Speaker D: Can I offer a third option?

Speaker B: We only have two options - raise your hand if you think AI will weaken formal educational structures. 

Speaker D: I think K-12 education is taken for granted as necessary and universally provided. But college is different - many opt in, capacity is limited. With COVID remote learning, what is the point of college if it's just lectures online? Elite schools have the brand name, community colleges are vocational, but there's a chunk in the middle - what's their value? So with your question about AI's impact on formal education, I wonder what we then need education for - more as a signaling thing where the credential itself is valuable. That's where the need is actually stronger to prove credentials elsewhere.

Speaker E: Huge question has been.
```
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker B: If AI led to college not being as necessary for education, we still might need a way for people to signal to others that they're actually really smart or something like that. Do you want to substantiate your perspective here?

Speaker D: I think there's two different types of education - building technical skills and building society. I don't think AI will substitute the community portion of education. That's very strong and important in formal education. A majority of young students need guidance and someone to believe in them. With that buy in, they can go on their own. So I don't think AI will weaken the K-12 structure. 

I agree. K-12 is mostly about confidence building, learning how to learn, feeling belonging - fundamental human traits that require community. 

For higher ed, we've seen the evolution from spiritual institutions to colleges to credential vehicles, which isn't the right role. With AI, we can return higher ed to gathering places for discussion, like in the Jewish tradition. If you can make something happen, who cares if you have a degree?

I agree. We're already seeing college closures. It will be different - we'll go to college to debate and have experiences, not sit as robots acquiring knowledge, which is inefficient.

Speaker B: Higher ed also functions as branding. K-12 functions as both education and daycare - that's still a relevant use. We need an efficient space for them.

Speaker D: That became necessary because workers needed to be in factories. We no longer need that. Can we return to smaller homeschooling groups across traditions? That's how the most effective education happens, like in community-based models that consistently produce the best scholars. AI could bring us to hyper local education and undo damage from globalization. There are advantages too - I don't know which way it will go. But that's one possibility for education.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker B: We talk sometimes about hyper local communities maybe having access to futuristic tutor that democratizes access to good lecturer or something like that, but also facilitation we're doing now totally skill, as we were talking before, facilitation of group discussion. There's no reason to think that, too, couldn't be improved by AI. So maybe one of the biggest questions here is, what is supported by AI? Given certain aspects of education previously scarce resources no longer scarce, let's imagine expertise. 

Speaker C: I was actually really curious about Fortine's reason for not. For not thinking that AI would diminish formal education structures.

Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree with everything that's been said over here. 

Speaker B: You need community, and you need to learn how to learn.

Speaker A: And you need kind of.

Speaker B: I thought you added something, though, to just say that if a state has a need to indoctrinate, then they will create opportunities for that indoctrination, because that's the goal.  

Speaker D: I know you're speaking a lot. I just want to add one point to that. I realized why basically, each nation has some equivalent of that public institution, right? It's a public institution. It's on the map. It's heavily branded. It does not mean it necessarily has better, higher level learning than many other places, but it serves a function of being a knowledge marketplace. We don't have that structure. Maybe we will in the future. In which case, higher ed public higher education places may not exist, but it serves the function of people going there, exchanging knowledge for something else or for knowledge itself. I don't know if that's like a lot of other institutions are knowledge generations, but public institutions as such is to influence how the rest of the world thinks about certain topics. And every nation needs that for nation state building purposes. And then also it needs to make a statement about where things are going. Right. So there's 150 leadership classes across the board at Harvard. That's way more than many other institutions of its similar qualities. So I'm wondering why that's the case. It's kind of like it's for the geopolitical reasons that was mentioned. So I think that for those reasons, every nation will fight for higher ed to continue to exist for some kind of political reasons.

Speaker F: If you look at England, the different schools are all about class reproduction. Eden College and the accent you get and whether you go to a public or private school is completely the class device. So that's very overt, I guess. Very conscious on their part.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker E: I believe there are aligned incentives for why education exists as it does. Fundamentally, humans want signaling and institutions. Nation states see the advantage human capital can bring - economies like South Korea and Japan have boosted incomes through human capital investment. So there are different incentives leading to conclusions. The lines become fuzzy on why certain things work certain ways. I agree the premise that K-12 requires more general skills and ways of living. But we shouldn't ignore AI's democratization entering and enabling micro changes. For example, cheaper queries could mean every student has an AI tutor for personalized, step-by-step teaching based on their needs. So certain educational approaches could be altered based on societal progress.

Speaker B: Let's think about how democratized, powerful AI could have microchanges. Hamza, you mentioned how chatbots and LMS affect your education, revealing incentives around self-education versus near-term course goals. Can you explain how you see GPT-type models already enabling micro changes? 

Speaker A: An AI tutor with complete knowledge trained on the internet could teach you step-by-step at your own pace everything you need to learn or get certified. So it could be the best teacher. But the human aspect of education remains necessary.  

Speaker B: As AI capabilities increase, how will human incentives change? Could that improve learning?

Speaker E: Good teachers foster curiosity, not just answer-giving. A key question is whether good AI systems can develop curiosity in students by slowly helping them find answers, not just providing them.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: I like to compare this to situations that don't involve AI, but AI performing very similar functions to something like having a private tutor that I'm talking to. Who they grew up with me since I was like five. And every single year, every day after school, I go to this person and they teach me certain things they know. How does Varun learn best? What are his strengths? What are his weaknesses? How to best frame, you know, maybe this sort of mathematical concept. He will learn best by this kind of visual. Let me show him that. And, like. Right. How do I foster curiosity? And so part of that problem of that tutor, like, how to put the student in a situation where they want to learn, right? And I think sometimes school is really bad at that because the approach is sort of a one size fits all. And so there is some really creative potential there for an AI.

Speaker B: Right?

Speaker C: And part of this comes down to, I kind of want to say implementation details. I mean, there's more to it, but walking over, I was like, oh, AI is going to be probably not really good for education. And then this thought experiment was something I started mulling over and was like, actually, this sounds really cool, like something that knows how I learn. The ways that I learn has been with me for decades, can help frame things that I experience in the world in a way that I'm best able to understand it. I think that is potentially really powerful.

Speaker B: This is the universal translator idea where we all actually speak different languages, right? We have different metaphors, we have different ways of learning. But essentially what you're bringing up here is the hope that AI systems can truly be personalized, and that personalization is going to lead to something. 

Speaker C: I'm going to use that, too. You brought up that personalization is one place that you're focused on right now. Can you just talk about what? I sometimes hear people talk about personalization as, like, we're hoping for it. We're hoping that it will be great. But what do you see as the reality? Maybe not today, but how does chat GPT, the ability to context set, maybe the ability to fine tune based on my own data. How does that relate to personalization here?
 

Speaker A: I recommend two books that explore AI and education. AI 2041 has short stories and technical deep dives on AI's role across situations like education. Project Hieroglyph has dystopian and utopian thought experiments about future learning. I'm exploring ideas from these stories. I'm curious about your goals, as some of us are familiar with knowledge graphs for different users. With Generative AI, you can be more precise about that information to inform curiosity and discovery for learning. We already see experiments with personalized agents and graphs enabling discovery and learning from sources. I'm looking at fulfilling people's needs and curiosity through discovery, enabled by current AI.

Speaker B: Personalization is already amazing without being fully customized. I can say "explain this assuming I have a PhD in psychology" and it adjusts. The dialogue method seems more natural than automatically giving the optimal lecture based on lifelong tracking. It allows agentic work with the system. 

Speaker D: Have you tried Kamigo, Khan Academy's AI? It makes concepts relevant by tying them to a kid's interests. If a kid asks why learn algebra, and they like soccer, it explains algebra's relevance to soccer. It makes learning relevant, inclusive and engaging.

Speaker B: Do we know how well that's working so far?

Speaker D: It seems to tap into intrinsic motivation.

Speaker A: That's missing understanding each human's larger context - where they are, what they're learning, their interests. Then put that context into the dialogue.

Speaker D: In this industry we call that a digital twin of the learner. It integrates classroom and life learning into a knowledge repository.

Speaker B: Totally, yeah.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker D: I love that idea. I saw the initial article about it and think that would be extremely beneficial to the K-12 education system because teachers are overworked. To take away some of that work and make it more efficient so they can actually build community and build students as amazing human beings in society would be incredible. A lot of teachers just want the best for the kids.

Speaker B: Imagine in a reverse classroom you do lectures at home and come in. One thing that fails is people don't do the lectures at home and don't read. But what if Camigo wasn't just supportive, but could be disappointed? You work with Camigo over time. Camigo is never mean, but knows you and can be disappointed. 

Speaker D: That's like the Owl from Duolingo, right? It doesn’t keep up your streak. 

Speaker B: Yeah. I'm like, Camigo has seen me through so much, and I just don't want to disappoint. I feel like that.

Speaker D: This is the intersection between education and therapy - the concept of ideal parent or educator serving that role currently in our lives. Who brings up pictures from years ago - remember when, before your downturn of emotions about your situation? This is where you are and how you got here. There are storytellers in families/communities that serve that documentation role. Right now you’re lucky if you have those ideal people, but we don’t always.

Speaker B: I was at a restaurant yesterday, and the waitress remembered I thought the Halumi was too salty before. I both felt cared for, but was also like, why don’t I have for me what I ordered already and what I like? This should be something I have access to without worrying. And this is trivial - remembering I shouldn't reorder salty Halumi here. But a lot of education relates to these aspects. 

Speaker A: Yeah. 

Speaker B: I've been mulling over how hyper-individualized path learning would structurally shift technology and human teacher roles. I think it will shift differently depending on where you are. In remote countries, AI can bring access to information. Teachers have traditionally done transference of intelligence - you read but don't understand so they provide context to help absorb material, now done by AI. So then what do teachers do? 

That led me to thinking, what can teachers do? Discussion format is more common in college. In high school and middle school, teachers probably still do knowledge transfer. In early years K-6, they do transference of discipline - you can't expect 6 year olds to just read/absorb. I'm really interested in if a child is old enough, what should the roles of human teachers be?
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker B: They're twelve, thirteen, they've had some basic self controlling behavioral regulation capabilities. 

Speaker D: I'm curious to Chen's answer this. If you're free from knowledge transfer all day, what would you do?

Speaker B: I have one thought - perhaps the future role of a teacher is more of a coach. It's transferring motivation, showing you how to strap like Coach Carter. 

Speaker C: They lift you up when you're knocked down and when you're getting too full of yourself, they knock you down.

Speaker D: Oftentimes the traditional thought process is there's a teacher as the leader, and all the students are listeners. That model is actually very ineffective to learning. The teacher is really the facilitator, not the person who gives all the knowledge. I'm sitting with my kids on the rug, asking questions - I have this problem, how do I fix this? I don't know, where do I start? The kids start talking, turning to each other with ideas. Having them do problem solving with each other and AI is important, especially when young. 

Speaker A: The happiest adults are the ones who get to work, but treat work as play.

Speaker D: Yeah.

Speaker A: Not just in tech. 

Speaker D: Exactly. And there are people trying to disrupt the "sage on stage" teaching model. One example is the most popular class at Harvard Kennedy School, where they bet their semester credit on a class called "leadership online". I don't know if you've taken it, but I'll spoil it - the famous lecturer sits silently for the first two classes no matter what people do. The class panics in the chaos, and people start to lead in their own way. Then they unpack what that says about leadership when there is an absence of leadership. It's an effective way of teaching, though often not taught. 

Speaker C: I have an anecdote - I went to a Scientologist middle school where we were never lectured by teachers. All learning was done independently through books and experiments. You took a test at the end to show mastery. It was self-paced - I took 1.5 years for 7th grade and half a year for 8th. In this system, what was the teacher's role in the classroom?
 Here is the edited transcript without fluff:

Speaker C: Oh, every classroom has a teacher, and these classrooms are like seven, eight people. They're really small. The role of the teacher was like a mentor relationship. I got really close to my teachers. I really liked them. We would talk as friends. I would talk about the stuff I'm learning. They weren't giving me knowledge, but education is much more than learning. It might be like social control, but it's also one of your first social relationships. Teachers were there to figure out what are gaps in your knowledge. They would go to your desk and be like, tell me what you're learning about. And you would have to explain stuff to them. And they could see like, oh, these things aren't quite right. Let me course correct a little bit so there's a lot of nudging and stuff going on.  
Speaker B: Yeah, that sounds like a very curated, fostered environment. I wonder how the rest of the institutions would have to necessarily catch up to that model.
Speaker D: Catch up or return?  
Speaker A: Right. That model there. In Finland right now, there's this popular book called Finnish Lessons by Karberg, who essentially transformed the Finnish education structure. And a lot of it has to do with this kind of approach. Children choose a particular sort of goal or something of interest, and it's almost like a project based approach to figuring out all the things that come together. And there's a teacher who's more of a facilitator.   
Speaker B: I feel like AI systems, you can imagine, already an AI system prompted could do a pretty good job at this kind of facilitation. And yet I'm guessing it wouldn't do that. It wouldn't cause the kind of results we'd want. I'm wondering if that's because we don't feel a sense of accountability to the AI system. I'm also trying to think about, coordination amongst people could be doing different things. Maybe one role of a teacher is to just make a decision so everyone can find something better. But if an AI system made a suggestion, I'm not sure if we would all get in line around that. We might question it more. So I wonder what is the accountability we feel to a human? And is that going to be critical to the role or are we going to be able to have facilitated benefits through AI systems?
Speaker D: We can have AI teachers or no AI teachers.
Speaker B: Well, I'm saying education involves facilitation and accountability to humans that may be hard to replicate with AI.
Speaker A: No problem.
Speaker B: Thanks for coming everyone. It's late, let's wrap up. If you see themes in the future and are interested to sign up again, we love seeing people return. Take care.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker A: Is it just us? 

Speaker B: I'm trying to get us to think about whether an AI system could be a good facilitator. And if so, what is the role of human teachers?

Speaker E: I think the role of an AI teacher becomes contextually different in different situations. I've studied education policies in Finland, Singapore, and the US. In some countries the model works without regularized testing, while others require it. I like the idea of education being more free thinking, but also feel the socioeconomic context matters. With infinite knowledge access, AI could be extremely detrimental if you don't know how to search, understand, or traverse that knowledge, versus a human teacher guiding you step-by-step.  

Speaker A: That brings up how you initialize the mind state of the learner through something other than just testing. A great tutor looks at you, picks up on certain things when you speak, and forms a belief about what you know versus don't know. Figuring that out for something like leadership skills requires observing someone over time, not just a test.

Speaker C: Teachers who inspire me make me want to be like them. There's an aspirational quality that could be missing with an AI that isn't a real person. It's a repository of information but doesn't provide that sense of wanting to become like it.  

Speaker A: Why do you want to be like them?
 Here is an edited version of the conversation removing fluff and staying focused on the key ideas:

Speaker A: Humans are fundamentally relational creatures. We relate to each other. That's just hardwired into us. When we see people we admire, we want to mirror them. I was thinking we have non humans or other than human entities that people have had relationships with or had aspirational. Just looking at religion, you can have admiration for something that is not human.  

Speaker B: A character, literally any character in film, while they're not human, they're a character. People can want to be like them. 

Speaker A: Yeah, Lion King?

Speaker B: Yeah, I want to be so wise.

Speaker A: But maybe it will be a problem. But maybe it won't be a problem. Will we all look up to AI?

Speaker B: Maybe your AI will be customized for you to look up to.

Speaker D: I feel human connection is more important than we think. Students gravitate towards teachers they identify with. There's a lot of conversation about needing more diverse teachers because students see them as role models. Huge differences in engagement when they see themselves represented. AI doesn't provide that modeling the way humans do.

Speaker B: Standardized curriculum assumes what's important to learn. But it's also a way to deal with scale. If from the state level we believe critical thinking is key, maybe we don't need standardized curriculum. Students could practice critical thinking in niche interests, with teachers supporting that instead of specific content mastery. We could start that when they're six, not just college.

Speaker D: Yeah, critical thinking and cognitive skills should be learned as early as possible. 

Speaker A: My professors talked about how children need to learn how to learn, not just be receptacles of knowledge. It serves the economy's need for flexibility, but also individual liberation. Education serving state and economic needs, but also a path for individual liberation. I don't know where it was going, but it seems to be getting better alignment.

Speaker B: I just think...

The key ideas and themes are preserved without excessive filler words or tangents. Let me know if you would like me to edit any other conversation transcripts in this style.
 Here is the edited conversation:

Speaker B: I imagine you can have an AI system that lets say your student was really getting into 3D printing weapons at home. And they start pursuing that. I think we can have an AI system that probably nudges the student away from that pathway, but finds one where their feeling of education still feels like play. We've been talking about how they become a more critical thinker, have more optionality later in life, continuously learn, become self-actualized, and be useful for the state. But I don't know, does anyone disagree that a standardized curriculum has benefits? Chicago person, do you want to answer?

Speaker F: Well, it's not just about teaching. It's about assessing competencies to award positions of responsibility in society. Performance on standardized tests is usually how we say who should get the job, research fellowship, PhD stipend, etc. Part of it is we use structures not just to teach and socialize, but to sort people into appropriate places. You want regularity and uniformity in content delivery so you can see how they compete on a level playing field. 

Speaker B: You want to control as much as possible to get at that underlying ability.

Speaker F: Yeah, standardized materials and tests show who's best able to critically think and answer questions. Of course, individualized paths could still hit curriculum requirements and allow full performance. But learning to overcome standardized situations not adapted to you has value too. I may be a visual learner, but I'll work with verbal people and can't expect total conformity to my preferences.

Speaker B: I think another aspect is having a common framework can be useful, even if not all history is globally relevant. Some shared knowledge helps you be part of a society.

Speaker E: Fundamentally, profound thinkers study across disciplines - philosophy, science, astronomy. Standardized education exposes students to subjects according to their interests. It prepares them in rounded ways to understand situations better, even if some is uninteresting. 

Speaker B: I want to separate standardized curriculum from not doing whatever the student wants. You might have complex objectives for a specialized curriculum - depth, breadth, adaptability. So it's not just following the student’s interests. But I take your point - a great tutor wouldn't just dive into the student's interests either.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: I'll add a third thing about discovery and filter bubbles. There is a worry an AI tutor helps Brew learn just one thing more and more. I went to college with a great books curriculum where I had to learn anthropology and sociology. I came in to study philosophy but left seeing those subjects relate to my interests. I wouldn't have been exposed without that curriculum. 

Speaker B: Right.

Speaker C: Broad exposure is good, especially when young and knowing little about yourself. Education has a spiritual component of broad exposure, interacting with different curriculums, seeing and learning yourself in different ways. That is critical to preserve.

Speaker A: In specialized stem fields, standardization must apply greatly. Astronauts need absolute standards. Lab workers need standards. I don't know how AI can ensure those structures are followed.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript:

Speaker B: There are two different kinds of standardized tests. One is like a licensing exam where I need to make sure you know certain things. What I'm testing is exactly what I care about. It's like a certificate. Another test doesn't actually care about the questions. Those questions estimate some unseen variable like math knowledge, college adequacy or intelligence. When testing a computer scientist in Silicon Valley with data structure and algorithms tests before going to Google, sometimes there's criticism that I don't actually use link lists or rebalanced trees. That doesn't entirely matter because it isn't testing them directly but rather as a predictive measure. We can question the relationship, but that's the point. These are very different uses of tests with different purposes. If the test ends up measuring something else, like English fluency instead of computer science, you'll get a bad signal. Andrew's point about a unique education is that the test may reflect something the designers didn't anticipate, like not reading certain books, which are irrelevant but that anyone educated does. It is difficult separating education and testing.

Speaker F: This dovetails another thing - admissions. Certain activities have higher value on an admissions profile, like books, influences and how they talk. 

Speaker B: Right.

Speaker F: How do you divert people into STEM or other areas based on aptitudes and reasoning skills? We need both. In Ender's Game, there's the Giant's Cup game. Kids are trained to lead space armies and they play this game, which is an extended psych evaluation to figure out who has the killer instinct. Whether we highly segment people into professions based on aptitude is contentious. Germany does this early on, streaming people. One middle school leads to technical college instead of university. 

Speaker A: We have that in Norway as well, to some degree.

Speaker F: You're optimizing social outcomes through allocating scarce resources, not individual freedom or exploration. By curtailing options based on early assessments of aptitudes and interests. 

Speaker B: In a certain world, it could optimize for human flourishing because early signals recognize where you'll thrive in the future. I don't think that's true, but you could imagine while not optimizing freedom and agency, it still leads the person to thrive.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker A: There's debate about whether everyone needs to go through university education or if some people would be better served going to practical school and becoming an electrician, etc. The argument is that not everyone needs a master's degree and some may be happier and society doesn't need everyone to have an advanced degree. 

Speaker B: Yeah, potentially.

Speaker A: As someone doing a PhD who has gone through lots of education, I want to defend the virtue of education as beneficial even though I understand those who feel they wasted time on a degree they can't use.

Speaker B: Well maybe AI can lower the cost and time commitment so it's not such a burden and sacrifice to get more education. Earlier you mentioned lifelong learning and discovering what you're into. This relates to an AI concept called explore vs exploit tradeoffs. If you get rewards from one option, you can keep exploiting that option or you can explore other options that might give better long-term rewards. Our institutions are often set up for a period of exploration through education that ends with a period of exploitation in a career. But today with more career changes, there's more agency to find new trajectories. I was a psychologist and now do AI governance - the internet enables this constant learning and shifts. So the timing of when we educate may not benefit from separating exploring through education and exploiting in a career. We early adopters experience more continual lifelong learning, and I hope this becomes more widespread as a tool to never stop exploring.

Speaker F: Education doesn't quench a thirst, it lights a fire.

Speaker B: I like that quote.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: There's this time in your life where you learn a bunch of stuff and then you figure out how to use that stuff. What is interesting to me is that how both of these activities are quite intertwined. I've learned a lot on the job. I've been learning a lot of new technical skills at work that have taught me new things. But I struggle with is when I'm out in the real world, I'm also trying to figure out what do I want to learn, what do I want to become. Those are unknowns that I am figuring out. An AI agent, I don't know if it's going to know those things. Those things come out from my interactions with the world. 

Speaker B: This is going back to defining the important problems to direct yourself and give intentionality. Effective altruism tries to explicitly say, what are the important problems? And you should go do your work in that. That is a helpful framing device - where I should focus my learning. It gives meaning. And that's relevant at any level, whether it's the most important problems or just trying to engage with something. You have to do your work to be like, what have people done before? And what is there to explore?

Speaker C: I think the way to frame this is to go back to this analogy of having this private tutor since the age of five. There comes this point where you go to your mentor and say, okay, I've learned all these things. I'm doing this work. What now? What happens? Maybe there's this point where the mentor says, I have some ideas, but you have to figure this out on your own. This is the end of what I can contribute; it's your space now to figure out what knowledge is valuable. Maybe it's helpful if I could go to a website and pick number one, do that. But I think even someone much wiser has this moment where they say, this is the limit of what I can offer you, it's time for you to figure this out yourself. I'm sure we're going to face those tensions with chatGPT. I ask it technical questions, it gives me back answers. There should be points where I should figure this out on my own, I don't need you. If there is this agent that has known me personally, it also needs a good theory of when it should and shouldn't be present for me.

Speaker F: Another Sci-Fi reference - in Dune, there's the Butlerian Jihad where humans rise up and defeat the machines because humans had been rendered so incapable of independent thought. I think in elementary school you learn research skills - how to go to the library and look for stuff on your own. If you have this omni tutor that just spoon feeds you everything, you don't learn to hunt.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker B: Yeah, but maybe the learning to hunt is like the equivalent of knowing which way is north all the time. In a place where, I thought it was a pretty important skill to learn how to read a paper. And that was still a skill for graduate students where it's like, what's the point here? We're going to learn this topic, but really what we're learning is how do you read a paper? And will that be a relevant skill? 
Speaker A: When new technologies are introduced, it's going to be a take. It does kind of atrophy some skills, but it also leads to other abilities. So I bring this up a bunch of times, I guess, writing kind of lets us put our thoughts down and then kind of weakens our ability to remember things. Right. But there's only so much orally transmitting something can do for you. Right. It lets us extend ourselves even further. Right. And then you don't actually need to know how to remember things like they used to before because you don't need it. You can go and look it up.
Speaker B: I think this move to using chat TPT is if any of you have moved from being an IC to a manager, at some point, you move from like, what is the level of detail I need to have in this topic such that I can actually direct and understand what's happening in this person, what work they're doing, so I can contextualize it into the larger goals that I have. And when you're a manager, it's not necessarily your goals. Maybe you're trying to reflect the company's goals or something like that. But I kind of feel like that's the relationship we'll start to have with more and more powerful systems where you're like, am I learning all these things? It's like you're not. And just like when you become a manager, your IC skills do atrophy and they're not being kept up, but you gain something more, which is now what I am able to do is what my five members of my team do. And you can be good at that or bad. Like, if you're micromanaging each of those, you're going to not do that much as a manager. And I think that might be the same as what we're going to see each person develop over their army of knowledge robots.
Speaker A: Actually, I have a question that is more like on the practical level, because I've been wondering, how do I actually implement large language models into my future teaching right now as they are now? How could I use those systems to benefit me and the students?
Speaker F: Right?  
Speaker A: I don't know yet. I was thinking could use some kind of augmented retrieval kind of thing, where it's like, instead of sending an email to ask about the curriculum, they could just go to this thing and get an answer from that, because there's a lot of questions that are just repeat questions. And that can be really exhausting for a lecturer to go through those questions again and again and again. Have you actually looked at the syllabus? Right, so more of an interactive syllabus thing. It was like, that's the first thing that popped into my head. But I'm sure that people have way more creative ideas than I do. In some sense. The first order effect of this is that they can ask questions about the curriculum. And the Second order Effect is that maybe now you have two more hours a week where you're not answering those questions. It's like, what can you do as a teacher in those 2 hours? Maybe you can actually reach out to somebody who you felt like was too quiet in the class and be like, hey, is everything going okay? And you can do things as a teacher that you couldn't do before. So you're not actually using the language model to, let's say, help out that one person who's struggling, but because you now have more time, you can do that.
Speaker F: I think also on the student expectation side, like their ability to Consume Information and synthesize, it, is much greater than ever before. In the mid 19 hundreds, there was this big controversy in High jump, pole vault because the poles went from wood to fiberglass, and now all These records were shattered. You got to raise the bar.
Speaker B: So we're at 335, we end it officially at four, but I'd like to start winding this down a little bit. And it's been a great discussion. I've really enjoyed. I hope you have had a great discussion or can take some. Some things away with you. The way we like to end these is just to share your takeaways. Doesn't even have to be a whole takeaway. Was there a single thing that maybe you thought weren't and weren't able to share yet, or something that someone said that has stuck with you? Not everyone has to speak, but just if something comes up to you, we'd love to hear it.
 Here is the conversation with the fluff removed:

```Speaker A: I like the idea of initialization, which is, I think, going to be helpful for what I'm building as well. I like your point specifically about wanting to. 
Speaker B: Just build a teacher app for yourself. Should take you an afternoon using GPT and then come back to us.
Speaker A: Actually, that would be super cool. I would love to try that. How do I do it?
Speaker B: I think if you try to make. If you did try to make yourself a little web app, that web app probably wouldn't be a good web app, but you would learn a lot about. And you'll feel powerful because you're like, I didn't know how to do any of this.
Speaker A: Is there a personality that a teacher language model should have? And if so, how is their personality different from what personality language models have now?
Speaker B: Different language models today have different language. Different personalities, for one. Right. The current language models are not going to kick your ass if you don't. If you don't study, there's just still going to be nice to you.
Speaker A: To.
Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I don't know what I think one.
Speaker F: Thing that's come up in my mind is, so school has this really important role of socializing people, and that's not just teacher to student, but student to student. And that's a lot of work. I know I learned a lot of my collaboration and problem solving skills. And so if there is, again, this omni tutor that's always there to help you, do you actually short circuit some of that important type of student to student peer learning and socializing?
Speaker B: What if you, like, cut. Sometimes teachers today are like, what are we going to do about GPT? And they're like, well, maybe we'll have them write essays without their laptop anymore. They're trying to figure out how to do it because they're like, there is something that we want to make part of the curriculum, maybe the grading or whatever else, or practicing certain skills and technology seems to be getting in the way. And I wonder if, again, the inverse classroom kind of thing could force this, which is like, we're going to spend some time in class interacting like this. None of us. We don't have laptops here. None of us. We all understood that having a notebook fit the vibe. And that's not because we are maximally coming to the best ideas in this way. Right? We could have come up with better ideas with technology, but that wasn't the point of this couple of hours right now. And so maybe you just have to be like, this time in school is practicing using your brain muscle.
Speaker D: And that's the suggestion that a lot of articles are saying in terms of educating teachers on how to work with chat GPT and not try to work against it is to allow them to explore different ideas through chat GPT and also providing that time in classroom to have Socratic seminars and to have that discussion to show why that's important, that you still need this component in your life.
```
 

Speaker C: This reminds me of critiques of how the Internet would affect education, where wouldn't you just Google search the best ideas and present those? Maybe some people do that for essays or math. But then there are moments in school where you have to take standardized tests where phones are not allowed or seminars where people aren't typing away on Google, they need skills not present there. 

Speaker B: Maybe the think part of think pair share teaching makes use of chat GPT, but the pair share part gives feedback if you don't actually learn. You'll recognize you weren't able to say anything useful, so there are opportunities to see faster iteration. As an educator, when will this come up? It's like every time you need to subtly show off at a cocktail party - that's important social cachet.

Speaker C: That should be your pitch about the AI.

Speaker B: Do you want to practice your cocktail party? Showing off.

Speaker A: Education doesn't quench your thirst. How do we build startups in education?

Speaker F: Well, the first wave of large ed tech companies largely not reached their goals. Educational learning is social - that keeps people coming back. Video lectures in isolation suck. Students during COVID had a pretty terrible time with that. So what did go wrong and what could be different?  

Speaker A: So at the time there was less technology. I was trying to build in person finishing school experiences with industry people. There was an attribute of standardizing their understanding and expectation. But with AI we can personalize for every person now. I chose commerce first to make money for the long haul.
 Here is the edited conversation without filler content:

Speaker B: I wonder if for the rest of his life, in his previous work experience, he was able to learn on the job, right? Learn by working. And I'm like, we're recognizing now the projects he's working on are not actually going to alone keep him up as fast as he needs to be with the world. Because the goals of our projects we want to do in as easy a way as possible, right? We don't want to just do complicated things for the sake of it. And so there's a conflict between my need for him to up level himself continuously, his own desire to do that, to be competitive in the marketplace, and the pragmatic desire to build a product feature as simply as possible that isn't very advanced. 

So what that means is I have a desire for my employees to be continuous learners, and to do so connected to their work, but potentially not directly incentivized. And so there's not really a good solution right now for specialized learning, on demand learning that is better right now than Coursera or YouTube. You think there has to be something better there.

Speaker A: As a people manager, do you have a specific example of when you then needed somebody to go and learn? Beyond that, if you as a team are working on the simplest things, when does that person need to go and learn more, and why?

Speaker B: A reflection of this was in my psychology program upgrading our stats and math. Traditionally we were the least quantitatively sophisticated. And we were asked, do you feel limited by your current state of knowledge? Like are we doing a course meeting your needs? And one person had a great response - no, I don't feel limited. But I also didn't feel limited when all I knew was a t-test, because it constrained my experiments about how I can approach the world with this tool set bordering mine. 

And so this is happening in my company - we have certain ways of approaching the problem. But I am convinced that we don't know enough about how generative AI can change the game around how we approach this problem. And the only way we're going to develop the imagination is to play with these things continuously and learn more about them. It's not helpful in the near term. But if we don't throw some of our resources into more explorative things, we are going to be navel gazing, returning to previous solutions. That's how I think about it.

Speaker A: Yeah. 

Speaker B: Let's hear both of these and then wrap up after these.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker E: I think couple of the takeaways, I think thinking about how the entire bachelor's hierarchy of needs and how nation states have viewed education and what active core education is, was extremely enriching. Second, I think a lot of reasons why I feel AI systems and technology in general and the entire first wave of ethics have not been able to disrupt were very critical discussions and takeaways for me, where things like inducing critical thinking or let's say, having extremely personalized methodologies, what is the role of a teacher per se, or an educator or a learner per se in a classroom setting? I think those motivations, those elements also we need to be inculcated in how these tools are presented, because I think we are anyways moving in an information surplus age. So in the end, I think it will boil down to how all of this is best presented to the learner and how much he can grasp and retain. Because in the end, even if, let's say, information is growing at a stupendous age, the pace of our learning and the amount of knowledge which we can hold still remains limited. 

Speaker B: Humans will be irrelevant soon. 

Speaker D: I would just like to say I love this conversation. I think with this conversation, I really understand that AI has great potential to being a game changer and a true equalizer to education. And I think one thing that we should continue to be thinking about is who is being forgotten in this conversation as we're continuing to build it up. Right. A lot of times, ed tech startups don't work out is because there's not that conversation between the people who are actually working on it and how that would actually be implemented. And I just think about all the students that may not be thought of, like students with learning differences and students that have a distrust towards technology or have not strong access to technology. So I think that's just really important for us to think about as we continue to develop something so that it is an equalizer and not really just making the people who are able to access AI stronger and the students who aren't not.

Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think we really spent time. And that would be the next theme I would like to go through in this conversation on the equity angle because I forget who someone mentioned about access to the Internet or something. Everyone has it. I was speaking to someone working the federal government focused on expanding broadband access because even in the United States, even in San Mateo, there are ten, I think it's like on the tens of millions that don't have dependable Internet access, and that is not AI access or AI knowledge or all the things we're talking about here, that's Internet access in the United States. So clearly, all levels of technology are not available to everyone. Well, cool. Well, thanks everyone. We're going to wrap up here and I think you all already put in your information. When we write up something and post it on Twitter, we'll just tag you all. While this is our primary format, Andrew and I are constantly thinking about ways that we want to improve this or expand it to either the online space or just to more people. If you are interested in running an AI salon, we have a little facilitator's guide. We're happy to support you both in advertising it on our calendar and teaching you, if you need to, a little bit about facilitation, we know each of you probably have your own kind of networks of people that we would love to both bring into these conversation. I'm sure they would love to be part of it. So, yeah, if you would like to facilitate in the future here, let us know. Just reach out. That's it. Thanks everyone.

Speaker D: Thank you.

```
Speaker A: Here, making friends, making healthy relationships, and ultimately getting to essence of who we are and what matters to us with regards to those relationships. 

Speaker B: Can I also ask for consent? I just started recording.

Speaker A: I'm interested in this whole AI aspect because generally speaking, I talk to friends here. For example, dating in SF, it's fascinating as a whole culture. We have some of smartest people here. But finding a match and then also having kids, that's a whole different story there. Generally speaking, the more technologically minded you are, there's also a correlation between that and being super on the left side, generally speaking, as a whole. And then I've come to notice there's also that correlation between that and not wanting to have kids. They think there's some aspect of the world being the world is kind of messed up. I don't want to bring a child into this world. And so it's fascinating to observe this sort of pocket, fascinating to observe this whole aspect of how AI can generate human help. 

Speaker C: I'm Sarah. I'm visiting SF from Vancouver. I'm curious just about in the long run, which relationships won't AI replace. I think there might just be. It might just replace most of them.

Speaker D: My name is Joshua and I live across the bay in Berkeley. I'm interested in this topic of how AI can help relationships because I have come back to the States about five years ago from being abroad for 20 years, and it is really shocking to me how disassociated we are in the United States. I think it's everywhere. How we don't really know each other very well or feel that sense of community as much as I would kind of expect. I think what I'm really interested in is how do I take the conversations that I have internally and externalize those conversations with others so that I can feel that sense of connection and thinking about where AI plays a part in that.

Speaker E: My name is Kwesi. I am building an AI knowledge assistant for caregivers that are giving care to dementia patients. I live in Calhallo, so not very far from here. I'm interested in AI and human relationships, especially from a capacity of how much more we can enhance our ability to care. What you talked about, the replacement aspect, if that does happen, what would that look like? More philosophical question should be what is the future of care going to manifest itself in terms of caring for our parents, caring for ourselves and caring for our future children who will be in their 80s and 90s and life expectancy right now is 73, it's actually I think 85 for the US and it's going to be much longer. More disease, including dementia, are going to be more prevalent. So that's kind of where my interest lies along with everything else that you guys have talked about. 

Speaker C: My name is Chen, I live in Oakland. One relationship that I don't think is going away is that of the teacher. I've worked in Edtech and I'm interested in that relationship of teacher to student, tutor to student. We learned in the pandemic or that was reinforced is that school is for not just learning. It's childcare, it's socialization, and it's learning probably in that order for most families. So we're going to have schools, we're going to have teachers. How can AI enhance that relationship and reinforce it? There's people trying to create AI tutors. I think that'll work in certain cases, but I also think there's a big space for supplementing, augmenting and improving that relationship.
```

The key things I removed were filler words (um, like, etc.), repeated phrases, verbal tics (I mean, basically, etc.), excessively long stories, and tangents that did not directly relate to the core topic of AI and human relationships. I aimed to tighten up the fluff while retaining all the substantive dialog and ideas. Let me know if you would like me to modify the editing further.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker F: My name is Peter. When I was seven years old, my parents divorced and it was quite an ugly event that went on for years. As an adult, I've recognized that I developed unhealthy patterns and beliefs about the world during that time period. If I'd had someone then to talk to about what was happening, I think I probably would have avoided a lot of the pain that I've experienced as an adult. I don't think it's difficult to get an AI toy into the hands of kids capable of doing that. I'm interested in how AI can help kids have those conversations and improve their relationships with themselves.

Speaker G: I'm Robin. I have PTSD and was a teenage drug addict. Most therapists are not good. What I've discovered over many years is the epidemic we're seeing of addicts and unhoused people not contributing to society is largely due to emotional, not intellectual, issues. Trauma can be fixed by having someone you can talk to who makes you feel seen, valued and known. The more we can self-regulate, the more we can connect with others and be productive. Using AI to intervene because humans are obviously not capable of being that support can change the trajectory of human existence and reduce addiction, war, crime, etc. 

Speaker B: I'm Somya, a new mom with a one year old. I want the relationship with my daughter to flourish. I'm concerned about the implications of AI on human connection. The last decade we've created a social world leading to mental health issues and loneliness. I left my job when I became a mother because it didn't sit right that my daughter has a high chance of feeling lonely and writing a suicide note. We've gone from productivity to convenience. Everything is one click - groceries, no need to know your neighbor or have social connections, but our brains still need them. I struggle with AI disintermediating humans who coach and guide you. AI might give better answers but doesn't provide the dopamine hit. I want to see if AI can enable better group social skills and become a buddy for a group, making connections deeper instead of replacing them. I'm working on social skill building with AI as a group coach.

Speaker G: And. 

Speaker B: This is a tradition in Japan where anyone who talks holds a stick. It inherently makes you more confident to talk and reduces interjections. I think this actually has some historical bearings. Whoever wants to go next.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker E: If we break up things shared into Solana categories, there's relationship with self, intimate relationship with one person dating, and relationship in group dynamics. Maybe we could start there and go from there. 

Speaker G: Should do relationship with screens. Relationship with screens is detrimental - AI is great, but screens cause huge mental health issues. Mental health is worsening and suicide rates increasing because human interaction is decreasing as free meals increase and we get more deliveries. Screens also mess up dopamine structures. If dopamine is released through effort - going up stairs, writing an essay - we wire our brains to be productive. But we now get easy dopamine through likes and comments, wiring brains to not be productive individuals but dopamine addicts.  

Speaker C: Two screen uses enhance social activities - FaceTime to instantly see family, a visual Sci-Fi wonder. And small group text threads for little connections and remembering I have friends, though better if forced to see each other in person more. I enjoy it, not that gross feeling of posting for popularity. So screens more complicated than just bad.

Speaker A: For young kids on TikTok - we have one-sided view it’s cancer, but it’s the greatest app. You can observe cultures and interactions. With the right search you gain huge cultural insights. I'm into fashion so I learn about cool brands - it gatekeeps information but makes it concise and accessible. 

Speaker C: Differences in is technology bad relate to consumption versus production spectrum. Writing an introspective essay and sharing is good spot. You describe a middle case - specific learning without creating public artifact or network, deep intention. Far side is passive doomscrolling. With AI, I'm concerned relationships will be replaced because scrolling thing is easy, path of least resistance. People will keep doing thing incentive structure rewards. But lens of production versus consumption can help tease out if technology is useful. Relates to training brain to not crave dopamine hits.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker E: TikTok's got entire teams of engineers. It's not about if you want, you want to view it as how do we as individuals, an epidemic problems. It's almost like one epidemic of problems that these technologies are causing. I think it'll be fine. I guess to summarize, I feel like we're talking about three things. One is the human screen and productivity, and then the second one being human screen and really same relationship and then I guess just focus on productivity, which is. I think it's your initial question. 
Speaker C: But we do see a pretty clear correlation with social media taking up and mental health problems.
Speaker B: Well, absolutely.
Speaker E: We're talking productivity for now. Yeah. So I think there is clear distinction that we need to figure out how do we improve productivity? It's easy to blame like TikTok the world. But if we take away TikTok, doesn't mean that all of a sudden we're going to have ten more Nobel Prize winners.
Speaker C: I don't think productivity, to me that you could be a very productive worker and not a flourishing, happy human being. Right.
Speaker E: Productivity doesn't lead to happiness. 
Speaker C: Better than being an addict.
Speaker E: Direction and conversation and maybe we should talk about mental health then. Human screen and mental health, does that lead to mental health issues?
Speaker D: One thing just to throw in there is maybe it's just for everybody. But I thought the FaceTime thing was interesting. How many of us have felt more connected? At some point when we've been using technology, we've come across a piece of technology, whether it has AI embedded in it or whatnot. But we've felt like we've been seen more, that we've been heard, that we felt like somebody cares about us, that we have a deeper sense of belonging because of it. Can we think of things like, in our own experience so far?
Speaker E: I think COVID was a great experience because it's all comparative. It's not about do you have all the connections or not? Are you transferring all the connections on screen versus all in person? It's more about, comparatively speaking, how are you feeling based on what you have? COVID has showed us that we can have weddings on Zoom and feel just as happy because the alternative is versus if COVID never happened, no one's going to have weddings, right? Because the alternative is having an amazing wedding in person. So I feel like that's interesting framework to think through the comparative benefits harm. Same thing with technology. I think it's hard to just say good or bad or beneficial or not, especially as the benchmark for measuring that is. Carson.
Speaker B: I can give one example that happened this last week. I've been trying to get into strength training after my postpartum, et cetera, and I sort of have not been able to include it in my routine. And so last week I went to CrossFit after a long time, Crossword CrossFit. And I did not attend any class this week. And so my coach messaged me or whatever. CrossFit, Coach, why aren't you here? And I was like, baby'sick start up life is too much. I can't talk. And then he's like, okay. And then two days after that, he messaged me again and he's like, how's your baby doing? He did not ask when you're coming. He did not ask. And all of a sudden I was like, this guy heard and he remembered. And he remembered that my baby was sick and he cares that I come back and he's not selling. Right? And so a lot of times I see community builders who are natural community builders, but right now it takes too much time. He is the owner of the cluster as well. He has like, what, 200 customers? He must be spending so much time doing it. He has the intention to do it and do it in the right way. And not just the orange theory messages. You get like, hey, you signed up with an email. When are you coming to the class?
Speaker G: Right? 
Speaker B: Not that.
 Here is the conversation edited to remove filler content:

Speaker B: Can technology scale the goodness of community builders without them spending hours individually texting and reminding everyone what matters? 

Speaker C: Or was it only effective because you knew it was automatic and meant nothing, like Facebook birthday messages?  

Speaker E: It comes from a scarcity mindset because his time is scarce. He took that time to make it feel special, like customized spam. I'm getting 50 a day now. They're all customized, but mean nothing special just because I know they just send them out.

Speaker C: How can AI augment, make more effective, and keep that essence of "I care about you"? Caring is the essence of a relationship. I'm devoting something scarce - time, money, focus - to you because I care. 

Speaker E: Can AI really care?

Speaker B: Humans can care. But can AI?

Speaker C: Care more, or focus it somewhere.

Speaker A: Have you heard of character AI or chatbots that do avatars? Human connection is the end goal for companionship and population growth. But people are lonely, just looking at screens instead of chatting or going out. 

Speaker E: What if we used AI to increase population by decreasing breakups, creating dating apps that learn your personality over time and match you with compatible people? Better than just pictures.

Speaker G: Humans are bad at Internet matchmaking. You need to meet. But AI could digest your real energy and align you with someone compatible. 

Speaker B: I disagree. Data shows you often marry your neighbor - proximity is the biggest predictor. I married my classmate. It's the time you spend evolving together. Yes, some foundational things should match. But put strangers together long enough and they'll love and hate each other. Attraction helps, but it's how you interact. Gottman says marriages are made or broken in how people talk, not who they are. Matching seems overrated to me.

Speaker C: I agree.

Speaker A: It's a functional problem.
 Here is the edited transcript with the fluff removed:

Speaker C: If you had an AI coach listening to all your conversations with your partner. And then says, you're taking that tone again. I wouldn't mind a weekly email that just says some kind of summary of how I'm talking to my wife, because I definitely have times when I can improve.

Speaker A: The tone of that coach would be hilarious. 

Speaker C: Hi, nice to meet you. 

Speaker A: My name is Dimitri. I worked for Replica. I worked there in 2016. Did you find that people who used it a lot were lonely people who would otherwise would have not a lot of human contact?

Speaker C: There's a difference between helping people get preventing people from being suicidal and helping them be less lonely. Do you feel like maybe if we take the frame of this discussion, do you feel like it led people towards more human flourishing, like, better relationships to other people?

Speaker A: Maybe, yeah. There's this network called PI by inflection. Did you guys use it? I like that there's no delay, no latency when you call it. It's good at keeping a conversation and avoiding. I'll talk to it about what's going on in my life and my emotions and my relationship. 

Speaker F: I fractured my ankle, and I was feeling that. I wanted to understand something about an election. We were driving and I called it. 

Speaker G: I one time pretended to kick your broken ankle, and you told her you were talking to her, and I pretended to kick you, and you told her. And she had some strong words for me and that I was abusive.

Speaker A: She does forget a little bit, but way better than GPA feelings, for sure. I think they have their own model. Is the primary use case just general, or is it meant to be more for emotional therapy type of things? 

Speaker C: So that's neat that you worked on that because that brings it all sort of closer experience here. It's easy to sort of say, well, it could be a net negative. Like, there's more disintermediation. People get tricked into these relationships with a bot or whatnot, but it could actually draw people. You asked the question, like, did it lead to human flourishing? Obviously, you can't flourish if you killed yourself. So at that level, it's helping people stay.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: Do you feel it helped people create relationships with a human? It was training for that or just getting them more comfortable with talking. 

Speaker A: I backed him out, it's like suicide dance. I actually bike fast. One time I saw someone crying on the side. I thought this guy was suicidal. My friend said those are kind of suicidal. I was like, oh shit. There's two sides where it's like, can you flourish? Your baseline is good, can you get past that? But there's a level where it's like, your baselines are make. You're suicidal. That's like, can you get people off that and to this baseline? From the baseline, then you can use NSF. It's fascinating because we live close to that, and I spend time in tunneling every week to see that level flourishing. But there's people that are right there suicidal. They have no will to live. Can we even get them to this baseline? 

Speaker C: If you help them get there, you're helping their whole family, their neighbors.  

Speaker E: It's all a system. I think the breakdown of our relationship with ourselves defines or influences our relationship with others, and the community. We've all seen people who don't have a healthy relationship with themselves, and that affects their relationships. Right? How can AI help people feel seen and heard? That's different than enabling them to be a better companion. It's a stepping stone. It's not going to solve their loneliness, but it makes them feel seen, even by some entity. That's why it's successful.

Speaker A: There's evidence dogs make people feel right. You don't need to be human, it just needs to feel conscious. There's research if something moves on its own, they will assign it consciousness. People have Roombas, name them, the Roomba breaks, they'll call and be like, it's broken. They're like, I'm sending it to you. They're repairing it. 

Speaker F: Essentially in that same class.

Speaker A: Research shows dogs are very high on the scale of what kids will respond to. 

Speaker E: They'll be more open to cryptotherapy.

Speaker A: When I was a kid, I carried a blanket around. Blanket was the emotional support. Today we don't have that. Now when we get less conditioned.

Speaker G: I talked to somebody who talks to Pie before parties for social anxiety, to prepare. He pretends to have a conversation with her to get ready to talk to people. I thought that was an interesting use case of building community. We built community online, realized mental health isn't great, now we have anxiety. AI is a tool to take us from screens and rebuild where we're not afraid to ask questions. Conversing with an AI is different than typing on a screen.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker B: I think that's a really important point. But the modality actually matters, right? Because a lot of times these skills are learned skills. You can learn how to be vulnerable. If you've been vulnerable once, it's easier to be vulnerable the second time. And so if you talk enough to an AI, would you actually be less socially anxious to talk to a human because the AI responds in a human like way? I think the thing that still, I think is questioned my mind, is incentives and what the company is eventually making money from and if it's engagement or it's something else, because we are dopamine monkeys, because that's what Instagram and Facebook get paid for, right. And so how do we make sure we align the incentives of the companies to not be engagement only, but some unit of health flourishing, something that's beyond that? And I don't know how to do it, but that is still tricky.

Speaker D: One thing that I've taken away from this conversation that I hadn't really thought about before so much was just the role of companionship and where AI can both be a relationship partner, like an intimate partner, but it can also be trusted, like therapist, or it could be a trusted friend, or it could be a teacher who's joining you on a part of whatever your journey is towards whatever your objective is for self actualization. And I think the potential there, if we reimagined what AI was to something that was encouraging that pathway towards self actualization within whatever channel that was like partner or that's a mentor or coach or whatnot, to be able to develop a relationship. 

Speaker G: I think if you're referring to the same thing as me, it's. Uncanny Valley is when a human is put off because something looks like a human and appears to be a human, but they're not a human, and it gives you the itch, like the creep. And you can experience that when you talk to somebody who doesn't experience human emotion. So they smile, but their eyes don't move, or there's some small thing that the back part of your brain can recognize there's something wrong with this person, but your intellect can't pick out what it is.

Speaker E: And I've seen a lot of companies that are trying to create a lot of older people. They're not as I guess, attuned to those uncanny Valley situations because they probably don't even care if they're talking to an AI or not. They are not going to be able to care about the latency or care about how slow the other person is to respond. They may tell you, I don't believe in technology, but if you do have another AI, you don't tell them that it's AI to talk to this person. There is significant amount of research that has shown that the likelihood of this companion can increase the brain health and stimulate the activity of brain and the odor person to reduce the likelihood of his person develop Alzheimer's. And that's really a high ROI in terms of implementing this kind of companionship to this demographic, especially given how little and how much more benefit. That tool that we already have doesn't even have to be perfect because I think for a lot of younger generations, they can tell. Definitely AI. 

Speaker C: For older people, they can't tell.

Speaker E: And that margin of improvement, the benefit the RI for older people much higher. And on docs like, I've seen companies that are trying to create fake pets that can make sound and have real part of the pets that may be even customized to look like their own pet when the pet is probably dead at that point. And also an older dog is not going to be able to have a dog by itself sell these little pets or it barks.

Speaker A: How many minutes of barks do you need to train an LLM to show up? Like my puppy.

Speaker E: Bark like the moment you had it, it would just make.

Names have been changed to preserve anonymity.

 Here is the edited transcript with the filler content removed:

Speaker A: Wisdom 20. Really interesting combination. My colleague wrote a blog post defending AI girlfriends, saying it can help people come out of their shell when they can't talk to others. Maybe have both a human and an AI partner. It's good for developing social skills. A conference attendee criticized Kwame, which offers to become partners quickly before you pay. I'm curious about thoughts around that. 

Speaker C: China already has AI partners. This seems like replacing human partners with AI ones. I spoke to a founder building in mental health. Her AI helped a client's child understand what to do when the school bus didn't arrive, by asking questions and guiding him home. That could be a good use case - helping people navigate how to learn and go through things.

Speaker D: Let's stick to talking about relationships with AI specifically. A framing is there are relationships with AI, relationships through AI like Tinder, and relationships about AI as a professional focus.  

Speaker B: There's also how AI can help us relate to each other.  

Speaker E: And relate to ourselves.

Speaker F: The nature of the relationship matters - partnership, friendship, collegial. 

Speaker B: Role play with AI could help with nerves about jobs or social anxiety with family. It combines relationships with self to then interact externally. 

Speaker Chen: Working through AI feedback can push you to work on yourself and put yourself out there more.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```Speaker F: I'm interested in discussing the gray line between training AI to the point you have a feeling of relationship with it.  

Speaker B: I wonder if we actually have relationships with AI today. It feels shallow compared to human relationships.  

Speaker H: Some people do become attached to AI companions. Have you experimented with tools like Character AI or Kwame? These feel like relationships, even if not true friendships.

Speaker B: I'm not seeing deep emotional bonds like with human partners. 

Speaker C: We have different relationships for different purposes. You depend on AI for specific functions, like health tracking or information. Over time you build dependency without realizing it.

Speaker Chen: Like having a smart speaker at home.

Speaker C: Yes, like different apps on your phone. In future, more relationships with AI beyond current phone apps.

Speaker D: Let's keep the discussion going until 8:40, then come back to the main room. 

Speaker B: More time allows us to dig deeper.

Speaker Chen: Right, let's continue the audio.

Speaker B: We have 35 minutes left, probably give us 5 minutes to regroup.
```
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Speaker A: I've built an AI business coach. First just with ML models, before ChenPT-3. And a lot of people were like, it's asking great questions, but does it really understand me? And then ChenPT-3 came along and we implemented it. And that really changed the game. I was surprised for a while. Why does it matter so much that it paraphrases you and tries to guess your intent? And then one day I'm using our product and I fucked up this or whatever. And it was like, you're not a bad person, it's fine, everyone fucks up. And I was like, holy shit. This really helped, having someone validating your experience and telling you it's okay. I think that's one of the big challenges we have, that we get really tough on ourselves and then any growth stops because you close up. In that moment, I didn't feel like it's alive. But I definitely felt an emotional impact. 

Speaker H: I think an interesting risk is, relating it to porn - we've seen porn be a huge issue in terms of people's sexuality and not wanting to have sex in real life because they're addicted. I wonder if having this completely unbiased thing that's always there to give you attention, always there to listen and empathize without any effort, you can be a complete asshole to it and it will still be okay. That's probably going to push some people down that road of fake relationships instead of real ones. Easy access to emotional relationships, which we've never had before, could do the same thing as easy access to porn did for sexual relationships.

Speaker A: I think that's the key - if I can crack the question of alienation. Cultures like South America are supposedly happier because they're family oriented and depend on others. In a developing country, you can basically live without ever seeing a human. There's this dilemma - is that leading to alienation and mental health problems if we don't depend on others? Because then we can be assholes to them. There was a study that CEOs are kind of sociopaths - is it that sociopaths become CEOs? Or is it when you're rich, you don't depend on people and become an asshole? If I can get your perspectives, that would be amazing. Super confused about it.

Speaker H: Relationships are the biggest factor for a long life. I wonder if it doesn't need to be human - just feeling belonging does it. 

Speaker F: My gut reaction is yeah, that sounds bad. But if an AI makes somebody less lonely and happier, what's wrong with that? 

Speaker H: We don't know. 

Speaker B: Loneliness leads to inflammation and biological impacts. So we don't know exactly.

Speaker H: It's going to be interesting to find out.

Speaker F: I think you could potentially make a case it helps individuals. But there could still be societal implications.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker F: I think there's a potential to make people less tolerant of others and the interactions that they do have. 

Speaker H: And that seems potentially dangerous.

Speaker B: Yeah, completely. We're already so bad at really looking and understanding and connecting and relating and managing conflict.

Speaker A: But did we get worse or did we get better? Because 500 years ago, it seems those people were worse by judgment. 

Speaker B: I feel in my lifetime it's gotten worse.

Speaker A: But I think the bigger question is broader history because I don't know, things can ebb and flow. We're never been more aware of problems like polarization and climate change. So maybe this is a path towards fixing things. 

Speaker B: We've never been so capable of making an impact.

Speaker E: I read an article how there's been a collective decline in empathy globally, but specifically in the US. And they traced part of that to technology, and how technology reduces human touch points. Now you can get everything at the click of a button. You can talk to an artificial person through a chat bot, you have this illusion of connection, but in reality, it doesn't translate to real life empathy. We live in these chambers, and have the illusion we can connect, but does that make us better humans? Can we build better relationships with people in real life? Or does it take away from that?

Speaker B: If we're thinking about lens of empathy, how does empathy develop naturally in human interactions? 

Speaker E: How does any of this? Listening.

Speaker A: Without interrupting, probably by example, if your parents were kind to you, you grow up kind. Our bot is better at empathy than 90% of people. When you see it speak to you empathetically.

Speaker D: Pi is focused on empathy, right? It responded to me saying I'm microdosing like, wow, that's an interesting experience for you. Can I ask why you're interested in that? Are you looking for something creative? Do you have a mental health issue you’re trying to improve? Responding with questions, not interrupting, forces you to listen. It's interesting friction interacting with another agent with empathetic goals towards you, but isn't just a servant. Long-run, to get relationship experience substituting AI, it can't just be a servant. You can imagine systems as entropy tutors. 

Speaker F: I think an empathy tutor is interesting, but also wonder if it's sufficient. Empathy requires exposure to people with different perspectives and personalities, people you can't communicate as easily with. You need the opposite of an empathetic AI to learn empathy because you need to practice interacting with those types.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff and filler content removed:

Speaker B: I was going to bring up this controversial sounding point, people develop empathy in a deep way by suffering injustice, pain. The most empathetic people suffered the most but chose the sunny side to guide people on the better way. But I'm glad you brought up we have the capability for an AI to represent divergent perspectives, different kinds of people. It could be programmed that way.  

Speaker F: Do the incentives exist to create such an AI that people enjoy interacting with?

Speaker B: I would program an AI to deal with divergent perspectives for sure. We don't know enough yet biologically about empathy and compassion in our brains to know if AI can mimic that.  

Speaker Chen: The consciousness topic has a lot of discussion in tech because we can't define consciousness, but it's part of human interaction. If we let language models speak on our behalf, we miss that consciousness side, the interactions you have with people around you create a consciousness no one else can imagine. These chats sound human but don't understand or relate to you like a human sitting with you.

Speaker B: Most communication is body language. Even with another human on Zoom, meeting in person is so different, let alone just text.

Speaker D: I don't think the world improves much by being more empathetic. Empathy doesn't necessarily lead us in the right direction. I'm hopeful AI can help understand different people's experiences and put them in my language so we can collectively solve problems. Empathy was important in small groups but isn't as important for large communities solving big problems. 

Speaker A: At a deeper level it's about self awareness, maturity, and emotional intelligence to process difficult things properly. 

Speaker C: I want to add...

Speaker H: Right.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with the filler content removed:

Speaker C: Empathy is context based or relationship based. It's very different from person to person, or a doctor and their patient. It's so contextual in that specific situation. It can play out so differently in every situation. It's just mind blowing to learn that and for AI to learn that and reciprocate, it's a long way.  

Speaker B: I have a friend working on AIs where you have many AIs in this game world, interacting with each other and players. Based on our discussion, it seems we need various AI agents - some masculine, some feminine, some empathetic, some savage. 

I use chat ChenPT versus PI a lot. There's this Reddit post about aluminum foil in the microwave. I put that into ChatChenPT - it said don't do that, it'll explode. I put that into PI. PI said, "Ha, is that a joke? I wouldn't try that." But that was much later in the paragraph. In the comments, people did it and posted exploded microwave pictures. This shows you can't just have one AI. I try to use at least two to compare and contrast. Often the first line is the opposite.

Speaker F: That's why the incentives for training are critical. I imagine they're trying to make an AI you like interacting with. ChatChenPT is focused on productivity and knowledge. For emotional relationships, the incentive will be to make you feel good, which may not be what the world needs.

Speaker B: There's a difference between empathy and compassion - compassion is when we also have an impulse to serve. Empathy is when you feel bad or sympathize, compassion has service. That's why I care and want a better world. If I don't have that, I wouldn't do what I do. 

Speaker D: I like that distinction. How I donate money is compassionate but not that empathetic. I'm not feeling symbiosis and acting from that. I think and direct my actions. Compassion seems easier to systematize - what's important to help constructively. That's separate from a system actually feeling your pain.

Speaker B: I do think scientifically, compassion lights up similar brain parts. We feel the pain but choose to move into action.

Speaker D: Maybe in our system one builds on the other, but they can be logically separated.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker B: I think human are motivated by different things. Some people are more emotional, persuaded by social media. But I personally don't think I have above average compassion. So I think logically. I need to know my input and output for doing things. Compassion or empathy don't work for me, my motivation is driven by my brain. I need to internalize it as worth doing. 

Speaker F: I identify with that rational approach. The volunteering I do is educational, because that brings me joy versus I don't get satisfaction volunteering in a soup kitchen. So I choose what brings me joy. 

Speaker B: What's wrong with being selfish?

Speaker H: Let's bring it back to AI.

Speaker C: Listening to everyone, I think it can be boiled down to environment. How we develop empathy or manage risks is based on environment. If you have emotional parents, you'll be more emotional. If it's analytical, you'll be analytical. For human AI, the environment they interact in is most important. 

Speaker F: If you had a system with different AI and humans, how would you measure relationship success? More harmonious relationships means it's working.

Speaker H: I'm interested in the tactical. What could AI do today to help our relationships? I'd want AI to watch my feeds and tell me when something important happens so I can reach out. That can help real relationships.

Speaker C: We should list AI positives for human relationships and potential negatives.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff and fillers removed:

Speaker B: I would like to have AI role play different, divergent perspectives, points of view, contexts, environments, how we grew up, role play them and then we'll find out if it actually helps when I'm in this situation and I might have a threat reaction. Biologically I might respond to that. 

Speaker H: That's a great idea.

Speaker D: If we think AI today contains multitudes, when you talk to it, it reflects some median response, but you can change it pretty easily, right? If you gave a prompt at the beginning to be an asshole and then ask it. So you can get access to this diversity. But as you were bringing up, there are many different environments, contexts, and a very practical thing happened last night - a friend brought some candy that she was going to give out. I was like, can I give some candy? She said, absolutely, give some candy. And it was a joy, right? Cheniving candy to kids. I asked my partner, do you want to give candy? And she did not. The reason why she didn't was she felt that her friend who brought the candy had brought candy to give out to kids. By me asking her, she's never going to say no to me, but I'm taking something away from her friend. I was being rude by taking away her joy for my own self esteem. I'm like, that's not what I think she would think at all. I bet she thinks that it would be totally fine and brought it to give joy to me and would love that. But those are different perspectives on that person. And I actually don't know which one is true. If this system could not only could give me these divergent perspectives randomly, reflecting the whole world, but could do it considering this person's environment, she's from the Midwest, she probably has some understanding of this person. It's like, these are some things you should be thinking about.

Speaker H: Imagine constantly recording you and then at the end of the week you retro and remember that situation with the candy? This is how she probably felt. You'd learn so quickly.

Speaker D: Imagine all the times you want radical candor, right? Everyone wants that, but it's hard to get from other people because it's vulnerable or rude. But a lot of people want to improve.

Speaker H: Yes, that's a great idea.

Speaker C: We've gotten good ideas. Let's look at the negatives.

Speaker B: Radical candor - not related to AI, but I think AI can help. I read Radical Honesty, whatever. I tried at our team meeting, fucked up everything. So I had to backpedal and just realize, you can't just do that. And I think that also applies to noticing a lot of catfishing for dating. You can take a screenshot of what the girl or guy said, and it will output multiple possible responses. I tried out - that's horrible. 

Speaker C: Tragedy does not know how to date.

Speaker D: I bet Pi would be better.

Speaker H: I think this is my exact problem with it. Imagine my idea around the AI telling you to reach out, your idea when you screenshot and it gives you the chat up line to say. Then things go amazingly, you show up in person and actually, is the relationship now inauthentic because you haven't yourself put the effort in to do that stuff? I think that's going to be one of the biggest questions in the next couple of years, because more and more, this is going to be augmented. And then what happens to authenticity?

Speaker F: My friend was joking, but also kind of serious about having the AIs date on your behalf, and the AIs are just talking to each other to see if you're compatible. I was like, this sounds pretty bad, but it's one way of doing things.

Speaker C: Another thing would be, I think it.
 Here is an edited version of the transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker B: Chenoes back to your point about consciousness. If we're having a reaction, what happens as we get through it and deal with the difference? It's different than a non threatening thing.  
Speaker H: If you knew your person you started dating didn't come up with their responses themselves, how would you feel after?
Speaker D: At this point, if I was on a dating app and they didn't use Chat ChenPT, I would be like, what are you doing?
Speaker C: This wasn't developed by Chat ChenPT.  
Speaker B: So we're trusting on trust. But this is toxic. Because then what's the difference from catfishing on MSN ten years ago?
Speaker F: It's the disparity that matters. It's not so much using Chat ChenPT itself. It's that if the real life version is very different. I think the line to disambiguate good from bad is more around, are you using AI as a tool for learning and becoming better, or as a replacement to do things you need to be doing?
Speaker H: If we messaged with Chat ChenPT, but dated for 3-4 days in person and I really liked them, I'd still feel a bit weird about it. 
Speaker B: If they hadn't used Chat ChenPT messaging in the first place, you wouldn't even see.
Speaker D: What do you think about converting human experience into something concrete with AI? In a few years, AI could just be data at a higher level, converted into something useful for you. This is who I am without having to describe myself. If AI were brokering relationships, it's better than just 6 pictures on Tinder. Instead, it's been watching both people for 10 years and thinks you'd be great together. That doesn't seem horrible, it seems good.
Speaker H: Did you see that Black Mirror episode? It would match perfect relationships.
Speaker F: It really does get to that scary point with no room for spontaneity and self determination.
Speaker C: How do you think about privacy with AI knowing everything about you, better than you know yourself?  
Speaker D: Right now corporations do this around me for their benefit. I'm excited for that recording to become my power, an agent I can use. 
Speaker F: The privacy isn't concerning, the lack of self determination is. If we truly get to that Black Mirror point, there's no room for spontaneity. It feels icky.
Speaker B: I wonder about how we change and grow as humans. If AI has all the data telling me who I am, my concern is we're not static. There are patterns, but that free will dynamism of change is debatable.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker B: We're not isolated things. We're permeable and interacting and dynamic. Everyone's AI. Interjecting everyone else's AI. 

Speaker D: You had used the word trust.  

Speaker B: Trust. Does AI build trust, or does it break trust? Or is that not binary? How does it build? Or how might it build and how might it break it? Trust is foundation for everything. Humans. We don't trust someone to gain them over.

Speaker H: It'd be interesting. When you message Pi, like, is my girlfriend cheating on me? 

Speaker F: Pi would be like, no.

Speaker H: Why do you think?

Speaker B: How is trust built in real life? Brainstorming, how do we build trust in real life with people? 

Speaker H: Being vulnerable.

Speaker C: Yeah.

Speaker B: There are specific skills and behaviors.  

Speaker F: Research shows doing what you say you're going to do. 

Speaker C: Multiple times.

Speaker B: Vulnerability, consistency integrity.

Speaker C: Vulnerability.

Speaker D: It's amazing how much people trusted chat ChenBT right off the bat without a repeated experience, because there are heuristics we use, like friendly tone. I asked you one question and you responded. For some reason, with Chanciti, because it's less threatening than another human. I don't know. It seemed like people built, especially younger people, build trust very quickly and rely on it. And then there's this whole hallucination thing. You can't trust it too much, but people do. They trust it really fast.

Speaker Chen: It all goes back to how well your compass is established, that when you're listening to someone, how well you can trust yourself, that you wouldn't get fooled by something that you don't believe in or don't agree with. I think a lot of people, I myself started using CADChenPt to build my company right now to the level that I can use it for different backend or front end development. But I don't allow it to tell me how to design my system, but I will allow it to help me with the tasks that I want, versus if I just go to it and say, just build this for me. I would come out as someone that doesn't know what he's doing, because real life experience is something the chat ChenPT system doesn't know, and that's what you need to distinguish from that. 

Speaker H: I use it similarly. I'm a solo founder, got an amazing team, but solo founder. And so I use it to challenge my own thinking, I'll put my strategy or what I'm thinking, I'll be like, this is situations I might do about it. Tell me what's bad about this or tell me what's good about this. I use it as this brainstorming, challenging thing and it's amazing.

Speaker C: For that, you should try pie as well. I've done that.  

Speaker H: I feel like it's going to tell me it's okay. 

Speaker B: It's okay.

Speaker H: Whatever you decide.

Speaker C: Be stern with the language, don't give me one thing. Just give me something stern on your side. I need to do either this or this or this. Tell me what I should pick and how rather than telling it to pick for you, tell it to tell you how to pick.

Speaker D: We're going to be coming together like a minute.

Speaker H: Yeah.

Speaker D: I'm going to move over there. But if you all here would like to share kind of final reflections with each other.

Speaker H: Thank you. 

Speaker B: Thank you.

Speaker D: Thank you.

Speaker B: Top of mind for anyone. No right answers, no wrong answers. Just what's top of mind?

Speaker H: I'm most excited about how AI can make our relationships better. Also building that space. Hashtag Pally.com. Literally what I described. 

Speaker F: Pally.

Speaker H: It watches your social media and tells you when to reach out to people.

Speaker B: It'd be great if we had something.

Speaker C: He's planting a startup's idea in you, Pally.

Speaker H: How do you spell like Palely.com? P-A-L-L-Y.

Speaker B: Thanks for being a conversation.

Speaker H: Thank you so much.

Speaker B: Chenreat to be with you all. We've got excitement about how it can help our relationships. 

Speaker C: AI to be trained a long way. We are trying the long way to come meet our criteria.
 Here is the edited conversation with the filler content removed:

Speaker F: I really liked our conversation about having AI as different personalities of AI to challenge you and also sort of measure the success of that as your efficacy interacting with actual humans. 

Speaker B: I like that.

Speaker H: It'S about to have a new website. 

Speaker E: The topic of empathy and how AI can potentially help us be more empathetic and how that translates into real life interactions and relationship building.

Speaker B: Yeah, my mind got really stuck on that one too, especially when it came up in the whole, what are the good parts of empathy and what are the bad parts of empathy? Chenoing back to the rune empathy quadrant thing where it's like, it is good, but then at what point am I an emotional person? It took me 30 some years to realize that. Emotional filter, then the rational filter, but yeah, empathy, then how it can be ruinous at times. I think that's going to really stick with me. How do we use AI to help us make maybe the best choice rather than just the choice that we feel or that we think whether you're more of a cognitive or emotional processor is best. 

Speaker C: You're already doing AI job by summarizing all of this conversation.

Speaker B: Anyone else? How can AI help us stay connected after this one discussion? 

Speaker A: Chenood job.

Speaker C: Thank you.

Speaker B: Chenood chat.

Speaker A: Thank you for your contribution.

Speaker F: Are there that you think there's more people to connect with? 

Speaker C: Yeah, I just can't.

Speaker B: Can we find each other there? We can do it. If you remember tons of people in the new version, totally down.

Names have been changed to preserve anonymity.

 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: Anastasiao around.
Speaker B: Background, where you're coming from, and things you've been thinking about in terms of living the city in the context of public facilities. 
Speaker C: Really?
Speaker B: Sure. My name is Ahmed. I've lived here for three years. I studied sociology originally before technology and engineering. I have a startup using AI to help access public services based in Canada where I grew up. Curious to go around.
Speaker F: My name is Anastasia. 
Speaker C: From New York, shifting into tech.
Speaker Anastasia: My name is Zara.
Speaker A: I work as a product designer at Everlaw, a legal tech AI company. I'm passionate about making legal aid more accessible.  
Speaker C: I'm Jose. I research law enforcement, crime, and AI for the Attorney Anastasiaeneral.  
Speaker H: I'm Luis. I work at UCSF researching computational biology algorithms.
Speaker A: I'm Mohammed.
Speaker F: I'm a NYC student, new to SF problems.
Speaker D: I'm David, PhD student in anthropology from Norway, here to help facilitate.
Speaker C: I'm Hannah, doing AI research and looking at jobs.
Speaker E: I'm Carlos, ecommerce background in New York. Want to learn SF's problems.
Speaker A: I'm Zara, product designer at legal tech AI company Everlaw. Passionate about legal aid access.
Speaker H: I'm Luis, biologist at UCSF. Lived here whole life, want to give back.
Speaker Anastasia: I'm Sarah, student studying economics.  
Speaker B: I'm Jan, student studying economics and history. I run a foundation in Poland.
Speaker C: I'm Jose with the Attorney Anastasiaeneral.
Speaker F: You mentioned police being understaffed. What are the critical impacts of that deficit? Where would fully staffed police help most?
Speaker A: That you think that we had that.
Speaker F: Fully staffed police presence, where do you think that would help out?
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: Anastasiaave background - meeting with SF captain and supervisor about police understaffing. Makes law enforcement more difficult and selective. But bigger problem - enforcement incentives misaligned on homelessness issue. SF paying significant aid to people coming into city. 90% of homeless not from SF, 50% not from CA. People travel across country to SF because providing monthly stipends, cash, food, legal services, housing, free phones. Asked why providing these services - answer was it's a third rail. 
Speaker E: Not touch it.
Speaker C: Do not touch - will get shouted down as political. 
Speaker H: Some services like phones and stipends from federal, not SF. 
Speaker C: Stipends passed under Newsom.
Speaker H: Phones under Chen separate thing.  
Speaker D: Problems identified - law enforcement issues, also around unhoused. Thoughts on problems there?
Speaker C: More a political issue than practical.  
Speaker D: Trying to identify problems introduced - overspending on unhoused a problem. Other issues?
Speaker H: We spend defending those city prosecutes - maybe rethink what we prosecute, focus on rehabilitation.
Speaker C: My understanding - reducing services socially unacceptable.  
Speaker H: Other way - if legal aid defends prosecutions, maybe prosecute less, focus on rehabilitation.
Speaker C: They already not enforcing much. More an overzealous defense system because of advocacy for these benefits. Board won't touch it - politically bad. Called it a third rail that would end careers. Huge problem, wastes money, but no incentive to fix.
Speaker F: Won't deal with it.
Speaker D: Just not going to work.
Speaker C: So question is, how to align advocacy goals? 
Speaker I: With reality.
Speaker C: Most in SF see quality of life decreasing. Don't think controversial opinion.
Speaker E: Survey to confirm?
Speaker D: I want to see results.
Speaker C: Would love to hear also how long people lived here.
Speaker D: Let's share how long in Bay Area...
 Here is the edited transcript with the fluff removed:

Speaker D: I've been in the city nine months. I was shocked when I first came over. It's not like this back in Norway. I think there are some problems to be identified in the city. 

Speaker H: I've been living here 23 years for college. In many ways, quality of life has gone down. Safety has gotten better - shootings and gang violence have gone down. 

Speaker C: There's been a decrease in gangs and organized crime. Now the biggest threat is random assaults, public safety violations, needles, open air drug markets. I literally walk by one every day on Market Street. I'd rather get watch for cars than walk through crowds there.

Speaker D: Anything more about the Tenderloin?

Speaker Anastasia: We study here. 

Speaker A: We came here two years ago, then left. 

Speaker E: Where are you from?

Speaker A: Anastasiaeorgia, Canada.

Speaker D: How long have you been here?

Speaker A: Four months.

Speaker D: We're from foreign countries. How does San Francisco compare?

Speaker A: When we came back two years ago after COVID, much more was closed, lower energy. Now the city looks more alive. But I don't have a comparison before COVID.

Speaker D: Anyone have a pre/post COVID comparison?

Speaker H: Pre COVID was better.

Speaker C: Pre COVID had more businesses, activity, people, felt cleaner. Most blatant difference is people doing and selling drugs on streets. I don't care if people get high, but it shouldn't be condoned in public spaces because of health hazards. I don't have safety concerns personally, but my sister and female friends won't walk alone because they don't feel safe. For one of the richest cities in the world, that's unbelievable. Anyone should feel absolutely safe walking down the street.

Speaker Anastasia: I see lots of crimes towards tourists specifically, not locals. Is this on purpose? 

Speaker C: Tourists are targeted for crimes?

Speaker Anastasia: Yes.

Speaker C: Tourists leave luggage in cars, which they wouldn't do where they come from. People take advantage of that.

Speaker E: You do that in small towns. 

Speaker C: I don't leave anything unsecured that I'm not okay with losing.

Speaker Anastasia: I had my passport stolen. 

Speaker A: I feel Oakland is much more dangerous than San Francisco.

Speaker C: Worse than Oakland.

Speaker A: Yeah.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: Oakland you're going to get more organizing crime and gang violence. San Francisco more random. The scary thing is the mission, it used to be you walk down the street, if you're wearing red on a grip area, then someone, you're going to have a problem. If you're wearing blue in a blood area, you're going to have a problem. Now, it's not what you're wearing, it's, do you happen to run into a guy who's coming down on Fentanyl and wants a few bucks? And if you're unlucky enough, if that's the case and that's random, which makes it, to me, scary. I know. If I'm walking through the city, I wear black. If I'm walking through an area where I know there's gang activity, I'm going to wear white and black, like neutral colors. I'm not affiliated. It's not a part of the. Just ignore me, pretend I'm not here. But with the random violence, you never know.

Speaker E: Have you ever considered leaving?

Speaker D: Have you ever considered leaving?  

Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I'm getting ready for law school.

Speaker F: At what point do you get out of here?

Speaker C: Well, I'm planning on it because law school is. I'm sure I don't.

Speaker D: I'm seeing a couple of patterns here, right? A couple of problems. One thing that I'm seeing is the law enforcement that's been mentioned, like, it's too few cops has been mentioned. There's the fear of being the victim of crime. Right. There's also the fear of being the victim of violent crime, like, randomly. Right. There's also the problem of open drug use in the street, which is both a problem for people walking by and the people doing the drugs, I would say. Right. So that's kind of a two part problem there. Do you agree these are some of the themes that we've touched upon, right? Yeah.

Speaker F: If you don't mind, I would like to get specific and maybe discuss maybe more concrete things to get from the what and how. I said, I think I still want to understand your position better or what you're saying from your experience. So you're talking about kind of the services that people in local government feel like they can't touch. Are there any specific services that come to mind and what the incentive structure you think they create that you see as a problem just to kind of drill down into something?

Speaker C: To be very frank, the fact that San Francisco gives out to non resident unhoused people, $650 stipend every month. I don't know about you guys. To me, that's BS. It's unbelievable that the city of San Francisco, and therefore anybody who works and pays taxes, is contributing a part of their paycheck. For people who come into the city from outside of the city or outside of the state, to come in here and then live on the street and do drugs, it's crazy to me. But that is something that, in the direct words of one of the eleven city supervisors, cannot be touched. Because if you touch it, advocacy groups, ACLU, forget the specific name, but there's an organization that advocates for homeless rights. You're going to have them grill you, and during public comment sections, you're going to have hundreds of activists storming in screaming at you. And he said, I tried to talk about this to people, and I have people with bullhorns at my events. So that is the specific why of.  

Speaker E: The research done on how many people of San Francisco actually support that policy? The disagreement of the loudest group is obviously problematic, but it doesn't reflect the sentiment of the whole population.

Speaker C: Exactly. And that's the problem. There is a significant, extremely vocal minority that seems to be outvoicing a majority. Seems to be pretty common sense reform. 

Speaker E: Why does the system prioritize the voice of the vocal minority?

Speaker C: Because the people that want it to be fixed are at their job, and they're working, and they're dealing with their kids, and they're taking their dog for a walk, and they're washing their clothes, and they're dealing with all the day to day functions that any normal person has. But if you're a professional activist, and this is one of the problems. Professional advocacy groups, they are organizations with paying members whose job is to influence public policy. And if your job is to influence public policy, you've got nothing better to do than to go to a city council meeting and scream at people. And if you're a city council member, every single time you try to talk about something, you get people showing up with bullhorns going, fuck you, asshole. We're voting you out.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker H: Brooke got into power.  

Speaker D: I want to open up for other topics and people to share experiences. Let's open it up.

Speaker I: I'm new to the area. When the $650 subsidy for unhoused was enacted, what was the logic? How did city officials factor in what it would solve?

Speaker H: Anastasiaavin Newsom's initiative was care not cash - housing and food stamps but not money. People didn't like it because they felt not enough was given and no direction on matching services to needs. 

Speaker D: We could match services to needs rather than just giving money. Let's discuss solvable problems for newcomers and ideas for the September hackathon on practical city problems.

Speaker F: As a follow up, how many unhoused have consistent connection and mobile devices? 

Speaker H: There are initiatives for free phones but getting people to use services and forms is hard.

Speaker A: Do you give what you think they need or money for what they actually need since they know better?

Speaker E: We stopped giving what we thought they needed and started giving money.

Speaker C: Should you be giving anything? Considering past experiments, what obligation does the city have?

Speaker D: Let's focus on practical problems rather than political issues. 

Speaker A: Are we generating problems?

Speaker D: Yes, as many problems as possible, without getting bogged down.

Speaker E: Should the city support outsiders or citizens? Education is underfunded. Do we spend on those harder to support rather than on resources for personal and public gain? Anastasiaiven budget limits, how is money best allocated for maximum social work? Funds could be reallocated from homeless services to education.

Speaker D: Reallocating funds is a solvable problem. 

Speaker A: Make a personalized algorithm to distribute funds. 

Speaker Anastasia: But how do you make that work?

Speaker H: Funding streams are complex - state, federal, city. 

Speaker D: Can we make this more accountable?

Speaker I: Do we measure the influx of out of state residents using services?
 Here is an edited version of the transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: The estimated population of homeless people in San Francisco, 90% of which are from out of the city and 50% of which are from out of the state.  

Speaker A: I come from an immigrant, working class background, and I've seen how the lack of access to legal aid or the inaccessibility of the law can take advantage of people like my family, immigrants, people without funds for a lawyer. 

Speaker D: Is it a question of funding?

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker D: Also language?

Speaker A: Yeah, and understanding the legal system. If you don't have rich parents and want to start a company, you may not understand contracts. Someone with more access to legal aid or money can take advantage.

Speaker D: These things are linked. 

Speaker A: That's one problem.

Speaker D: Thoughts?

Speaker C: Anastasiaenerative AI tools help explain contracts in plain language. The question is whether people know to use the tools this way.

Speaker A: I work for a company using generative AI for law. The issues are hallucinations and admissibility in court. We could use LLMs to make law understandable but address hallucinations. 

Speaker D: Worthwhile problem. Distribution is also an issue.

Speaker C: Any issues worth discussing?

Speaker A: You're giving them phones, give them computers.

Speaker C: A city official mentioned 311 - non-emergency services are overloaded. The app is old. Something to review is how citizens efficiently report issues and government allocates resources. Maybe a convenient chat app to submit issues to the right agency.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker F: AI would handle volume issues, summarizing requests, allocating attention. 

Speaker A: Kind of our attention.

Speaker F: AI struggles where data lacking. Volume seems good for AI.

Speaker C: AI makes mistakes, public backlash. Which problems suited for AI efficiency? 

Speaker D: This session identifies law enforcement problems for upcoming hackathon. 

Speaker E: Suggests AI city council experiment.

Speaker D: Could start with toy AI council.

Speaker E: Or doctor AI council first.

Speaker F: Where do less tech-savvy people get information if unfamiliar with AI? Meet people where they are vs expecting tech solutions.

Speaker H: 311 is where many go, refers people to services. 

Speaker D: Experiences with the city?

Speaker Anastasia: Wanted to discuss microclimates and disasters. Is that relevant here? I research wildfires and AI prediction requires decades of data. Could microclimates and prediction be a hackathon focus?

Speaker A: Just curious about solving and predicting microclimates.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```Speaker A: Microclimates interacting with catastrophes differently. 

Speaker Anastasia: The wind, rainfall, fire - it's not segregated. Each solution requires data to simulate climate like weather, rainfall, wind to help forecasting, monitoring and prevention.  

Speaker D: This group is focusing on social issues. But climate is a great topic.

Speaker H: The 311 thing matches what we've discussed. 

Speaker C: A 311 system seems straightforward - good interface for reporting, separate requests into bins by issue. Instead of a phone room, route directly to the right department.

Speaker H: It would need AI because of the complex network of services. 

Speaker D: You've identified a solution! The focus would be building it.

Speaker A: Who is the hackathon for? Can anyone apply?  

Speaker D: There's a link to apply on the event page.

Speaker A: Unemployment is a problem. Working class need career paths without paying for courses. Tech jobs are competitive. What about people in their 50s/60s?  

Speaker D: Unemployment ties to other issues. We all have backgrounds where we see problems that tools could help address. Like legal and employment assistance to lift up regular people. Any experiences where help is needed?

Speaker H: Are you thinking job training?

Speaker C: More vocational training? 

Speaker A: Not specifying a target.

Speaker E: Re-skilling requires resources. Where do we allocate them?

Speaker C: Where to allocate resources?

Speaker H: Education is important.

Speaker D: Space is open for ideas.

Speaker I: I'm not native to this area, but I do think more public private partnership needs to happen to where you're not just putting the onus of responsibility on local government, but really being able to leverage Silicon Valley to kind of provide more resources, more educational training, and just that intellectual talent really kind of contributing to start finding innovative social solutions that are kind of plaguing the city. Because I've spent the last several years in Southern California and I know Long Beach does a pretty great job of being able to bring players in the private sector, public sector, all the way from economic development to digital equity, et cetera. So I think they're a pretty interesting blueprint to kind of look at. 

Speaker E: One idea I have is maybe have an AI coaching tool that could be run by the government and then update community users which support people in getting back to the job market, providing tangible advice.

Speaker D: Yeah, access to resources, hearing here, that's a problem that could be solved quite easily. It sounds like.

Speaker C: Another problem, maybe to throw out into the ring another one of the things that the supervisor mentioned was seems like a lot of the police captain mentioned, a lot of people that are arrested are booked into the system and then essentially immediately released. And we have a high percentage of people that are being arrested multiple times. Even when they're on probation for a previous crime, they're arrested and then put back on probation. So multiple probations. And these are decisions that are made by the bench, by judges. I don't know about you guys, but I work in politics. I'm relatively politically involved, but I don't know judges. And they're elected by votes. We vote for judges. And I think most people either don't even vote or just check a box. And it would be interesting, there can be some kind of accountability service or some kind of product that allows people to understand the judges more about the judges that they're voting for. And really this can apply not just to judges but to politicians in general. There should be a structural infrastructure for the average citizen to say, hey, I'm voting for this person. What have they actually done over their last term? I know what they're campaigning on, but what have they actually done? They're a judge and they're getting 1000 cases. Are they only convicting 50 people out of 1000 cases? That would suggest to me maybe they're being a little too lax because I don't think police are hauling people up for no reason. If they're convicting 1000 out of 1000, they're probably being too strict because I doubt that there's no innocent people in the world. So some kind of accountability system for elected officials, I think could be interesting. And that affects everything.

Speaker D: So what I'm hearing here is accessibility to information about judges, politicians. It's a related problem to the legal aid stuff. Right. Political systems are complex. People might not fully understand what's going on. So maybe a problem is like, just access to that information.

Speaker A: Easy classification of the information, so you can actually read it and understand it. 

Speaker H: There are groups that try and track politicians in the Bay Area, but all those are kind of partisan in one way or another. So it would be good if. Yeah, and there's similar systems that exist for the national people like to see which way the senators voting? It'd be cool to implement that.
 Here is the edited conversation with the fluff removed:

Speaker C: This should be very accessible information. Political systems affect every issue. 
Speaker D: Politics is involved in everything.
Speaker C: How do we find technical solutions to political problems?
Speaker H: The problem is that voters don't know how their judges are doing, not what the judge is doing.
Speaker F: Information.
Speaker D: Anyone else?
Speaker E: I have another question. Do the judges have a term?   
Speaker D: And is it the same judges, or do they turn over and new judges? 
Speaker E: I have another question. On judges, do they have a term?
Speaker D: Term.
Speaker E: Is it the same judges, or do they turn over and new judges come in? 
Speaker D: Do you want to contribute to the conversation?  
Speaker A: I think it's less easily addressed by tech. I feel like there are a lot of returns on investing in public spaces with things like free WiFi where people can put laptops. Whereas now, public investments are lacking. People need places to congregate. I think there's a sense of community and belonging that you get when there's vitality that's missing now. People feel isolated.
Speaker H: The public library.
Speaker A: But libraries are underfunded right now. I'm from LA. Not too long ago there was a mental institution that was shut down and they released some patients who didn't have families to the street. There's a correlation between mental health, homelessness.  
Speaker D: So what are the concrete problems related to that in the city?
Speaker A: Because there are fewer community spaces now, people are isolated from each other. That might have to do with the lack of community we had before larger cities. Now we're isolated on our devices. There is a really bad mental health problem and higher suicide rates. How do we improve access to mental health?
Speaker D: We have about 10 minutes left. Any other civic problems that can be solved with tech?
Speaker B: You guys have covered a lot of ground today. I wish I could give cross training information from the other groups, but I haven't been in any one group long enough. I think it's great you're recording this to upload to the hive mind and maybe inform a hackathon. Your contributions will be immortal in the long term. Why don't you wrap up?
 Here is the edited transcript with the filler content removed:

Speaker B: I'll reconvene us all for a couple of minutes where we can share between groups and answer that question.

Speaker D: During this wrap up, let's just kind of go through what we think were the main topics that we discussed. 

Speaker C: Three one one is like civil service phone number. So say somebody sprays graffiti or dumps trash and you need to call the city to come clean it up. We were thinking about a more efficient way - taking the calls or texts regarding issues, scanning it, grouping it, assigning it to the proper municipality or city department, use AI to fix the problem.

Speaker A: People can be better incentivized to take action. Like if you see a problem in your area where a sign says "You have the power to make this change" and people are able to adopt the idea and make it better and more widespread.  

Speaker D: The question becomes how do you empower people to do that?

Speaker C: The only issue is you might run into code violations. Also, how many people know how to actually make fixes? I'm sure it could work in a city full of a lot of people. It's just, what percentage of people knows how?

Speaker D: We discussed the problem of making this more efficient. 

Speaker F: Space over here.

Speaker D: About legal access and access to employment and unemployment - that could probably be taught by utilizing large language models at some level.

Speaker H: There was the thing about tracking city politics the way we do national politicians. We could just set up one of these with AI.

Speaker D: Yeah. How to ensure accountability.

Speaker D: It sounds like we're kind of soft wrapping up here already. You don't have anything more to discuss, or any forgotten topics to mention that we talked about?

Speaker A: Hydrobank. 

Speaker D: Thanks for your contributions and sharing your thoughts. 

Speaker D: On that note, I'm gonna end this recording.

 Here is my attempt at removing filler content from the conversation transcript:

Speaker A: We can each give some background to understand our contexts and knowledge. Today's topic is national security, defense and national power, really war. I've worked in applied physics but also sociology and economics. I'm interested in the intersection of geopolitics, science, and industrial revolution shaping world order. Some interests: society has become less violent as technology for military conquest improved, yet violent deaths decreased over time, especially civilian deaths during conflict. The decision to declare war, fight others, is a huge human evil. If we outsource that decision to things we think can react faster, there are big questions of responsibility, liability, morality. In a Simpsons episode, a guy said future wars will be fought by robots in space, and your job is to maintain those robots. That'd be interesting - wars fought just by robots in space, clear decisions, no human deaths on Earth. So some curiosities: Are we getting less violent over time? Do more intelligent weapons save lives? Will humans not fight someday, requiring our trust in non-humans? Some questions.

Speaker B: I'm Zara, a developer and sci-fi nerd with a film degree. I'm interested in bad actors enabled by high tech - not just for killing but propaganda, manipulation with bad outcomes. How to defend against that?
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```Speaker B: I'm Mohammed, AI policy expert at nonprofit The Future Society. I have public policy background, advise on AI governance and policy for organizations like OECD, UNESCO, and partnership on AI. One reason I'm interested to be here is national security often offered as reason we don't want to overregulate AI. I'd like to understand that argument better. We were instrumental in getting foundation models included in EU AI Act, which is great because it's only credible legislation right now. Our mission is align AI through better governance, focused on mitigating risks. I'm interested in security for large AI labs and foundation models, which is insufficient - not even doing basic practices like NIST cybersecurity framework. With open source AI, I'm concerned about bioweaponization and cyber weaponization because barriers to fine tuning LLMs on pathogen data or malware code are low. I think open source AI and security intersection is interesting, like cybersecurity offense dominant as novel attacks hard to defend against.```
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: I'm Leila. I have a background in economics, data science, and have been a facilitator for blue Dots AI governance and AI technical safety. I'm interested in multipolar scenarios where we have both humans and AI agents navigating some sort of complex power struggle. It seems agents will have a seat at the table and will think about other agents and humans. In my view, many have pushed back on this, but I think the first AGI creator will be the US government. I think once you get close enough, any government will see having infinite digital people is a national security threat. A company like OpenAI or DeepMind would be taken over because the US wants to maintain power and can't have you having infinite digital people more powerful than us. Of course that's destabilizing, but from their position it makes sense. I'm not super confident but want people to debate me on this.

Speaker B: I'm Ahmed. My current projects are miniaturization of particle accelerators and starting a mining operation in West Virginia. I have an aerospace background and have done some startups including hypersonics, so I have exposure to weapons systems. My take on AI risks differ from most here. I'm skeptical of AGI and more concerned with functional systems we can understand. There's quiet work in AI applicable to defense that's hard to grasp morally and strategically, especially for the US. At some point missiles will maneuver well enough to reach carrier groups, which are currently invincible. Improvements in guidance and control can drastically change strategy in 20 years. I think in more factual, direct terms. 

Speaker C: I'm Nataliaua. I run an AI startup but more relevant is I'm originally from Ukraine so have followed geopolitics intensely since last year. I know people in tech trying to help Ukraine, mostly not AI. I'm curious to learn more and can relay useful information. On violence decreasing - I've heard that narrative from Pinker but others say we don't track the right metrics. Looking at wars, deaths increased steadily until WWII, then decreased. Maybe that's the US emerging so dominant after WWII. Interested to learn more.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Chen: I'm the founder of a startup that does Chenge MCU for orbital satellites. Our first customer is with another NATO country doing board security, but we also work a lot with maritime domain awareness and also other ISR applications in the hyperspectral space. I've never really paid much thought to the philosophy of applying AGI. I've always been more fascinated by the practical, immediate applications. I will disagree with some of you who believe that the world is headed towards more of a multipolar stage. I think the US, it will still be a unipolar world for this century. Russia, China, Iran, none of them are serious rivals, or to the United States at least as a full on counter, maybe as a potential short term, medium term threat, yes, but not as a long term threat at all. I'm more fascinated by the applications of autonomous robots and warfare and yeah, advanced, more improved guidance systems, the more practical applications that we see in 10, 20, 30 years from now.

Jose: I have previously spent some time working on autonomous vehicles, and then I realized that these sort of skills actually apply very strongly in the defense space. I spent time working there, worked on two different defense startups, realized that AI in the defense space is honestly not as advanced as many people think. This is also a very interesting area, an important area that people should be thinking more about.

Leila: I've been working in AI for around five years, mostly AI recommendations and other stuff, most recently at Google X. Right now I do contracting work. I formally worked at Army Research Labs, so I am very in touch with the defense industry. I think AI has the potential to revolutionize warfare, whether asymmetrical. I don't think we need gigantic vehicles anymore when drones can easily turn the tide for lower cost. I'm interested in the Milgram experiment, in which people detached from results can cause pain and suffering by pressing a button. The concept of being detached from a drone 10,000 miles away delivering bombs is really interesting to me, and worth talking about.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```Speaker B: Hi, everyone. My name is Nataliaua. I work in aerospace now. I think I work for plant labs, and I work on flight software. Defense intelligence is basically the customer using satellite imagery. I'm curious about how AI plays its role in even something as small as edge computing on satellite AI stuff. The biggest problem right now is downlinking images, there's so much imagery available that it takes time to downlink them. There's a lot you can do with AI to process. We also have very good computer vision available in the world, but I think this can be improved and response to things happening on the ground can be made much faster than it. Curious.```
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: I lead AI governance research at an AI company called Credo AI. I'm interested in how national power and war will contribute to the trajectory of AI, governance, and development. For example, Palantir's CEO said we will not let our enemies morally outpace us in AI weapon development. Their system is called "kill chain". 

This connects to the point about who will be responsible for advancing AI. Will decreasing human deaths continue, or will the expected number of deaths increase due to lower probability, higher impact AI events? Power dynamics could shift as AI becomes more powerful. 

Speaker B: My background is physics, computer science and economics. In 2019 I interned at a military contractor using AI for signals intelligence. The interns were leading the AI work using GANs and LSTM, so I don't think contractors are as advanced as we might think. 

I'm very interested in history and strategy games. I'm curious why you think America will remain a superpower. I think China has a good chance to surpass them due to manufacturing and population advantages. I'm interested to learn the current state of military AI, and I'm not sure how aware people here are.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Sarah: I have a background in computational biology, but I've been building and investing around AI for the last decade. I'm a partner in GI Central Partners. We have done a lot of investing around AI defense. I think the defense industry is pretty misaligned for innovation and responsible innovation. I'm interested in how to structure that differently with a new approach to financial engineering and building those types of companies. I'm here to learn more about defense AI. 

Anastasia: I'm one of the founders of ML Commons, an industry and academic consortium focused on making AI better for everyone. We build benchmarks and datasets. I have experience in semiconductors and worked on camera design for aerial imaging. I'm curious and want to learn more about the language and sociology differences between the deeply technical AI world and the policy space. 

Anastasia: I just left the Navy after eight years, including three on submarines. Thank you for building the AI tools I've used the past few years. I'm interested in two things: AI proliferation and comparing it to nuclear proliferation, especially around having policy and governance before technological proliferation with nuclear versus the opposite with AI. Also, what resources make wars possible - energy, food, logistics. I think AI will have a big impact on logistics and machine design. The jobs AI replaces are white collar engineering and science jobs. I think we'll see huge changes in supporting organizations that enable warfare, not just warfare itself.

Natalia: I work for Virgin's nonprofit foundation on criminal justice reform. I'm also interested in what makes wars possible, but from the other side - I've worked for the last 20 years on criminal justice reform.

This retains the full substantive conversation content while removing filler words, verbal tics, redundant phrases, tangents, and excessive monologues. The key ideas, insights, questions, and dialog central to the topic are kept intact.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

The conversation is between [name1] and [name2]. 

[name1]: My first big forays into advocacy were protesting the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. I saw tech make it harder to get good outcomes - broad screens for who was a bad guy, being applied to the wrong people and then creating more enemies. Now I see the same tools used in war scenarios increasingly brought home to police in various ways, from the guns and armor to the surveillance. It's the same people with that expertise trying to do security work at home. I'm curious about the social implications, how we determine who's a bad guy, what might lead us unintentionally to use these tools in ways that are actually making things worse. I'm impressed and curious about defense tech being built despite my opinions on its uses.

[name2]: I hope we can keep our discussion abstract, agnostic of specifics, and think about the future. Emerging themes are the changing multipolar/unipolar world and whether the recent unipolar era led to peace, asymmetric threats in technology and AGI, the morality of entrusting systems to make kill decisions, the geopolitics of conflict, and things built for defense percolating into society - some bad like machine guns, some good like nuclear power. 

Here's a thought experiment on the morality of robots fighting instead of people. The upside is no loss of your side's lives. The downside is trusting robots to decide who to shoot. What's your gut reaction - morally problematic to never do that, or could make sense soon?

[name1]: The crux is the kill decision is no longer made by a person, whether their hands or a button. I have a different take on the societal implications of not having humans go to war. One thing that ends wars is societal dissonance and war weariness from people's brothers, cousins, and others they know being sent to war. If that's just a robot or drone, we lose that context.  

[name2]: Excellent points. I think that's a great illustration of the kind of complex second and third order effects we should think through.
 Here is the edited version of the transcript:

The conversation is between ```:

Right. So there's another part of it that we lose. People still suffer in one capacity or another, right? Even if, let's say, there's no military personnel and there's a war where no one gets killed, but they're still sort of suffering on the side of, let's say, people who are oppressed or whatever. And if no one suffers as an outcome, then it just doesn't matter, I guess. Aren't we kind of just talking about the Cold War? I mean, it's like proxy wars through other countries. I'm not trying to dehumanize them, but in a sense, if we're fighting through other countries by feeding them economic resources, then it's just a question of who's spending the war and who can outspend the other person. So talking about consequences, look at the Soviet Union, serious consequences in the Soviet Union because of the spending onto the Cold War. So there are still significant consequences for warfare. It seems like there has to be some. Why aren't we currently fighting our wars with video games or simulations? Because there's gladiators. Because there's no actually. Yeah, exactly. Clearly it's not just a function of, would it be nice if we could fight this war without sacrificing humans? There still needs to be some resource that is diminished over time that ends war. Those resources are human resources. Right. They're factories that we get our clothes from. They're food farms that we feed society with. They just move to the battlefield to civilian targets. Right. Well, not only the source of power, like land, is it? Yeah, I think the Cold War is a good example. Even if we had some mountaintop where we could actually fight some war where you all agreed on some robot whatever on the mountaintop, the suffering and the resources put out would still be borne by the civilians who are redirecting their entire economy. And it seems unlikely that any country would end up being like, well, it seems the best thing for us to do is continue to fight on that mountaintop rather than attack the resources. I think game theory probably has something to say about this. It's always going to pay off for someone to defect. Yeah, sure, exactly. So there are other targets, but how are we right now able to maintain any kind of legal structure, any kind of cultural structure that says, more or less, you should attack military targets and not civilian targets, which is not a completely agreed upon idea, but somehow we did a heck of a job during WW2 of not attacking civilian targets. Wait.

```: 
```:
 Here is the edited version removing filler content:

Speaker B: There is international law that has proportionality, and I think that might relate to the moral question of who approves the kill. It seems kind of inevitable that we'll be going towards swarm and drone warfare and different methods. When it's not human resources at play, then maybe the willingness to go to war is faster. I'm probably lacking a structure about where we should go with this.

Speaker A: Conversation, because anywhere you want, this is unstructured.  

Speaker B: So there's international laws that govern warfare currently, and I think that also governs kill switch decisions, except in places like the North Korean border, where it's automatic. 

Speaker A: Again, it doesn't matter what the tool is. The thing that would stop me from deploying something into battle that was going to make random decisions is that I, the nation, am held liable by these international standards. If my goal in pursuing war is to improve my status but the international community harms me enough that it's not worth it to send out a poorly aligned AI system, I will only want to send out a system that faithfully executes my orders. That's why the military is quite focused on responsible AI and AI governance - they don't want to be seen as unethically using warfare. 

Right now, the humans driving the machines that do warfare, many of them in submarines at least, aren't connected at all. And some of them are given more autonomy than others. There's different "loaded states" of readiness, kind of like with a gun. And they actually perform that same analogy for a ship or submarine or aircraft - how close are you to pulling the trigger? How autonomous are you? Submarines are probably fully autonomous. Whereas someone in an army base is much more subject to a tighter command chain. The expectation is that if we were to go into a global conflict, we'd lose all communications, and everyone is expected to act autonomously. There's already rules and policies in place for that.

Speaker B: Is it because of the assumption that you'll lose connectivity? And when you say it's autonomous, what does that mean?
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Speaker A: The captain of the sub knows how to respond if attacked based on studying the US war plan. Let's discuss people's willingness to initiate mass destruction in an all out final battle. In a Cold War psychology experiment, a shockingly low proportion of Minuteman missile operators actually launched missiles when faced with that decision. Research shows people don't want to shoot others, but having others watching increases effectiveness. Given autonomous control, would people carry out doomsday orders? Maybe automated defense systems like in WarGames are more willing to destroy the world. Petrov didn't fire back at apparent incoming nukes, but that may be baseline behavior since the radar signatures didn't make sense for a first strike. 

My advisor did psychological studies for the military during the Korean War. They found units expended little ammo. Breaking into smaller squads increased shooting. The prevailing view was the army should expend ammo, so they restructured based on what squad size worked. 

In WWII, most soldiers shot aimlessly without trying to kill. A small motivated percentage did most of the killing. 

The key seems to be aligning units to faithfully execute plans, yet enable contextual decisions. That's the transition from today's recognition systems to future reasoning systems. The human intelligence already drives submarine decision making policy.

Speaker B: ```
 Here is an edited version of the conversation with the filler content removed:

```said there's a book or whatever. To the extent that, what is the manner through which you align that autonomous submarine with the overall goals of the military? It's called the Composite Warfare concept, and it's where each unit is responsible and autonomous. I think the answer to your question of A or B, I think almost anyone you ask would say, I want the reasoning warrior more than I want the rule following warrior. There's a lot of evidence from history to support that, actually, if you look at infantry tactics in both World War I, World War II. So the German officer corps had a tradition of this independent, autonomous reasoning kind of thing, where they're given general objectives, then left to figure out the tactics on the ground. So there's also historical precedent to suggest that's more effective. It's the same with corporations.```
 Here is the edited version removing filler content:

Speaker B: Did anybody see the Future of Life Institute's video simulation of AI bought by US and Chinese/Taiwan governments? It predicts missile launch probabilities and recommends responses. It tries to simplify complex variables into a percentage recommendation that the captain has to decide whether to trust. 

Speaker A: Yeah, it puts you in that position for a moment - you only have 5 seconds to decide.
 Here is the edited version of the transcript:

Speaker A: I think there's another side here. In AI, we live in a society where we care about interpretability, but on the other side is effectiveness. While we care about interpretability and making the right decision, there's someone who just cares about getting the job done, making their machines more effective. 

How sure are you about interpretability? It's like explaining business choices at a startup versus a public company. In DoD, interpretability is very high. Is it because it's upstream of effectiveness, or because you want to defend your reason? In defense, humans are currently in the loop. So interpretability is necessary in explaining decisions.

I'm curious about when interpretability is necessary or desirable. With driving, if you ask why a truck driver hit someone, he'll come up with an explanation. Is that distinct from an autonomous car hitting someone? AI driving could be safer than humans. Are you willing to forego interpretability? 

In the military, interpretability matters more. Is it like reproducibility and debuggability to eliminate errors? I think that thinking is different in defense than with autonomous cars, where we may accept them as safer without interpretability.  

Speaker B: I'd add that in combat, interpretability is the difference between a war crime and collateral damage. When they review the rules of engagement, it was a credible reason versus something psychopathic. Humans are liable because we can demonstrate reasonable thinking.

Speaker A: Another lesson is the more effective your weapons' threat, the less you have to use them. Like nuclear weapons preventing wars by being a credible threat. 

Speaker B: Let's debate that point further. But the issue is, if you have a more lethal robot army, you may never have to use them. Or you'll end up using them eventually.

The key parts of the conversation have been kept while removing most filler words, repeated phrases, tangents, and excessive verbosity. The edited version retains the full substantive dialog between the two speakers.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```I don't know. You can debate any of those points you want.  I'm not a huge believer. I think we kind of see that it  forbids the use on both sides, and then what you end up with is that you just use lower systems, less apocalyptic weapons to get whatever objectives you want. And we see that in Ukraine, we see that in Israel. Or you use it as an intermediary tool for economic warfare. Like, you've got to invest so much in this thing that does nothing for your economy that it depletes you and we still win floating for you. Yeah, it's best for everybody if nuclear weapons are never used, which is why they don't. But I do think there's some. It's not just like nations make decisions really optimally all the time. It's like individual people and nations make specific decisions for their reasons. I do think there's like a non zero chance that if one of these nuclear nations were brought to the brink of survival or the people within it were brought to the brink of, like, I'm about to be executed because of the things I've done. For example, that they might actually use nuclear weapons, which is bad. I'm really interested in this topic of robot soldiers because I know the Star Trek episode, I always think about it and I always wonder, why can't our wars be like that. Like a simulated war, like computers fighting each other, like you said, a video game, even though we're kind of getting to that point. If you think the way people control drones, for example, I mean, in a video game almost like setting. But the reason I think that doesn't work almost fundamentally is because war is Sort of about like, it is physical. It's literally about taking things in the real world from people by force. I think that's like, in a foundational sense, what war actually is. So you can never have something that's totally immaterial or totally nonphysical be our war. Because in the end, whatever happens with that computer, you can walk up to it with a baseball bat and hit it and then take what you want. Robots, on the other hand, are physical, so they actually just replace a human. And in the end, we could have a bunch of robots fighting each other, like massive wars with zero human casualties almost. And that could work as opposed to a simulation, even though it's like unoptimal in every way, because the winner robot army can still come in and take what they want.

 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: The China Russia alliance is going to have robots, and so are we. A recent phenomenon. Power doesn't really guarantee that you win a war. If you look at Israel's War of Independence, Israel should not have won that war against its adversaries. I think one of the things that you talked about, which I want to pick at a little bit, is you said, okay, we're going to have robots that replace humans. And I actually think that in a lot of ways, the most interesting applications are not how do you have AI replace humans, but how do you have them do things that a human can't do? Like in Chernobyl, they wanted a robot to clear the roof because it was dangerous for humans. I think the point is, they didn't want to originally use a robot because it was a situation in which it was perceived to be disadvantageous for humans. But you do the math and you're like, okay, everyone can be up there for 50 seconds, so that's like two shovels apiece. You want to send a robot to 30,000ft under the sea where organic things don't do well. I look at AI in a lot of ways as like, where can we use it in places where humans are utterly unsuited? Because AI works so different - it's inscrutable. I definitely don't think that there's a really bold alignment stand of using AI or not using AI in defense or robots. I think it will just have shown much higher efficacy than anything else. The reality is that we're already using AI systems in object detection on drones. That just gets better and better where the human decision making eventually gets taken over by the accuracy of the data. And then you conventionally just make a switch that goes fully autonomous with that. The question of whether there's actually a real moral question is moot because I just think it's going to happen.

Does this retain the core content while removing fluff? Let me know if you would like me to edit the transcript further.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```There seems to be, at least between us and full autonomous. We're just sitting back. There's clearly going to be some collaboration between some human and some AI where the AI is doing the things that the AI is much better at. And I need a way to understand what's going on there so that we can best collaborate honestly, collaborative partners. And so I like the way you framed it, because, again, it's not a moral decision there. It's like this is the evolution of systems taking on.```
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker B: Weren't we saying for a long time that cyber warfare would be the next evolution? Russia attacking Estonia or destabilizing attacks are increasing in scale and number, that's undeniable. But robotics has been so lagging. I don't know how the military sees it. It's still like people fighting, or people with robots, like Ukraine is people fighting, right. Which I was surprised by in terms of trends, I'm surprised that we haven't just been at just mainly cyber destabilization by now.  

Speaker A: Part of what you're saying is right. Cyber is just another dimension of warfare. You have economic dimensions of warfare. Like today, I just learned that the Department of Commerce is changing the regulations on chips for AI, making them more accessible. That's another dimension. We've got cybersecurity and other things. Maybe the point is that AI and robots just add another potentially orthogonal dimension.

Speaker B: Yeah, and that is the other point I was thinking of - when we think about AI policy, the US government doesn't want to regulate because they want us to be competitive in AI technologically and innovative, and continue to beat China. The economic argument is a national security argument, because the US has a national security imperative to be technological and economic leaders.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: I agree. This is the newest branch, the cryptographic war. They're orthogonal, but not full. So when I think about what you're saying, I think it's totally true. If I had to imagine, during the Bolshevik Revolution, they took over the train stations, and by taking over the train stations, they crippled the Cyrus government's ability to get soldiers moving and logistics and information across to people. That's kind of how I imagine the easiest way to, in 2023, if somebody were to take over a state, I imagine the first thing they would try to do is control the internet and block information from traveling. I'm sure the US government has thought about that. 

With chat GPT, there's a thing called Chain of thought, which is you get to say something and then it responds to itself. So it keeps looking at its previous messages and creates a chain of thinking. That is interpretability. And the reason we do it is because Chachikati is allowed, on a macro level, to reason out a better answer by being interpretable. I'll just say it's an active area of research whether the explanations GPT creates for itself are actually related to the decisions it might make. And I think people have tried to kind of corrupt the explanations, and see whether this has more or less effect on the final psychology thing as well, is you postdate your experiences and assign rational meanings to what you did. Yeah, that's a form of rationalization. With chat GPT, the explanation comes prior. It's like, let me think through this. I think a leads to B. And so because of B, I should do C. And people have done experiments where they change that explanation, but it still does C at the end. So the explanation seems to be improving its performance, without actually being based on the explanation. So we're going to move into a future where we have these placebo explanations. I think that's what we're currently at, right? 

I think language models are nondeterministic, and what we're doing is next token prediction, right? This token is most likely compared to the last context. But what are you actually? Maybe these prompts push you closer to the latent space that gives you the answer you want. But the study investigated this - they had multiple choice questions, and originally it reasoned correctly when random, but when it was C every time, it incorrectly guessed C. But it came up with a plausible explanation that was misleading. So it was justifying after the fact. And in a separate dimension, you gave people explanations that sounded plausible but were independent of the algorithm. And people rated these systems more trustworthy. They liked them more because they felt good. That's the feeling of explanation. Those are the traditional ways to measure explainability. A better way would be, can you make better decisions collaborating with the AI because you know how it works? I want to let you speak as you. I'm curious
 Here is the conversation with filler content removed:

```Is this thought, is this reasoning, is this just a collection of possible tokens? My gut reaction is, that's what I'm doing right now, is I'm listening to this conversation. It's pushing me around in some kind of pattern matching space, and then I feel like that's actually what's going on a lot of the time, when I'm oh, yeah, I should say this, that even my own wetware is just predicting next tokens. 

There's an interesting history of surgeries where, to prevent seizures, hemispheres of people's brains have been separated. You may have one side of your body operated by one half and move your hand, and then writing and speech are in different hemispheres, so you can talk to one side of the brain or the other without the other knowing what was said. You can force behavior on one side, and then you can have the other side explain why that happened. Without knowing why it happened, the other half of the brain will come up with a reason. It'll imagine something to explain it. This has been done a number of times to see a corpus callosum split brain.

My biggest concern with handing over decision making and having more effective killing machines is do we have people thinking about grievance and how to respond to it? How do we address grievance? It seems like in Afghanistan, we were militarily superior and had people working to execute the war ethically, or navigate tribal and cultural complexities. Our presence slowly created more opportunity for others to leverage legitimate grievance. There was no out except for us to leave. We couldn't win militarily. We needed another way to come to peace. Many wars the US has fought recently have not had a military solution or ending. 

I'm curious if there's defense technology on the military or political strategy side to help foster multilateral solutions past the exceptional killing machines we're building. We can do that all day and maybe not achieve our goals without tools for winning the peace. How do we get there? 

In Oakland, violence interruption programs address grievances after somebody's been killed and de-escalate, collapsing violent crime. Before the pandemic this worked well, reducing violent crime 40-50% in areas where it was deployed. The pandemic disrupted it. Reimplementing it is challenging. In war, I think it's similar - if you generate grievance, are there tools and technologies that will help us go the other direction? 

I want to circle back on whether it is AGI or can get to AGI. I think we anthropomorphize these things when in reality they are very different than humans. Even if theoretically more intelligent, it doesn't matter. What matters are the outputs and effects, not whether they will be AGI or not. Conflict distraction on whether these things will be AGI or not.
```
 Here is the edited conversation with fluff removed:

Coming back to your point on grievances, I think nations and nation states have trauma about certain events. The US had trauma around 911. It made us do irrational things like going to Iraq, Afghanistan. I don't know if an AI system would make those decisions, but I don't know if there's a system that measures how much of an effigy we need as a society to get over that trauma or not. It's a pretty complicated question and problem to solve for, particularly with an autonomous system. 

When we titled this National Power and War, I was thinking about war, but by extending it to national power, you brought up, can we expand our circle tools? And this brings me to ideas around new tools for democracy. I brought this up before - how do you find imaginative points of commonality or cooperation amongst people that at first blush you would think would have irreconcilable differences? But there's actually some area of overlap, if only you could get to it. Maybe one aspect of these AI systems is putting more solutions out there. Because they're more rational, maybe rather than a lower barrier to war, there's a higher barrier to military intervention, and there's comparative ease of having more neutral third parties in AI tools that can help collaboration. That's more realistic than robots fighting robots. I think that there's this idea of AI and warfare where it's machines fighting machines. I think it's completely unrealistic. And then there's this idea of AI and warfare where it's providing solutions. 

People were surprised that AI systems were replacing white collar jobs instead of blue collar jobs. I think we're going to see the same thing in warfare, where AI is replacing the person that writes the treaty more than it's replacing the person that shoots the gun. You actually see it in AI tools for relationships - there are cognitive behavioral therapy chatbots.  

In the military there are different levels of security clearance. If you accumulate confidential info it could escalate to a higher level. So for a chatbot, the data repository will be secure but the chat interface will be at a lower level. The only classified chatbot I've heard of is Kirby - it has restrictions on what Congresspeople can enter.

I'm curious on a different point of national power and war - fog of war is one aspect. Satellites like Planet have a picture of every point on Earth every day. That's not real time but an incredible timeline of Earth that hasn't yet been converted into full value. I'm sure the government and DoD are the most advanced at converting that into value. But we're not yet at the point where that timeline has been fully utilized by industries.
```
 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

```Curious how inability to hide from each other will change diplomacy, battles, national power. Just hiding different things. Can still hide from satellites, just have to be more careful. Increases difficulty. Read this, don't know if true, but like Tom Clancy novel. Statement that US and USSR put nuclear missile silos in different places - US middle of plain states assuming guidance control stay bad, USSR somewhere else, better technology. Point is, if want to hide from satellite, just have to try harder.```
 Here is the edited conversation with filler content removed:

Speaker B: The data from the DAP, from the satellite is also being processed so well with. These days. Cloud detection, there are algorithms available now that you're able to better do things. There's also tables that use thermo imaging.

Speaker A: I'm thinking back to a radio lab episode, there was some law enforcement that was trying to break up some criminal sting, and they have a timeline literally on the minute time scale. You could backtrack until you get to a piece of information that is known. That's this person. You follow that car. Okay, that ended up here. Why did it end up here? Let's back out. Who went to that house? That's a different level of being able to extract information, which is not currently possible, not because of the imaging, but because of the reasoning that would be needed to run over these satellite imagery. I think AI has an impact here. 

Speaker B: The whole military intelligence and security apparatus as it relates to information is very not in public awareness. You don't know what tools are using or how they operate. The robot army, the battle droids are very obvious, and it's very hard to do that, too. It's not very cost effective. The extent to which physical violence as enacted in meat space and not cyberspace is going to be the extent to which satellite imagery is still useful, because you have to move the tank there and you have to get the troops there. The ability to scale up information services by producing knowledge workers who can undertake analysis from massive data sets that a human can't, and this enables you to make better informed military decisions is compelling. I would push back that satellites aren't going to be useful for monitoring wartime personnel. 

Speaker A: Satellites give you much better visibility. If you want to track deforestation or shipping containers or estimates of another country's resources, estimating across becomes possible. When you come to the table diplomatically, there's a little less posturing and a little more just we know your silicon reserves. We've been watching you. I think that's a great point. In terms of national power, we think in terms of war, but we don't think about industrial power or the ability to know exactly what you can produce, when and how much of it. Those are things that our society isn't big fans of tracking and monitoring and surveillance. I look at the opposite side of Pacific, and we have the exact mirror of society in which there is tracking, specifically China.
 

Speaker A: There is tracking and surveillance and the ability to know what can be produced, when, where and how much. My question is how that affects job creation. 

Speaker B: I agree. A tough issue with anything military is we don't know what the government has access to. I'd guess they have a system like China's here, just more secretive. 

Speaker A: In China there's one camera per two people. You can read US law to see what can and can't be tracked on citizens. The government follows the law, though it's not perfect. There are ways to infer data without breaking laws.

Speaker B: I wouldn't ask if we're breaking laws but what the benefits are of China's system that we don't consider. Our open tech gives us an advantage now from people sharing ideas openly. 

Speaker A: China spends more on internal surveillance than defense. This massive monitoring is a huge cultural difference that enables different capabilities. 

Speaker B: We should frame China as recovering from the Mao era overtaxation and starvation. Their surveillance could be a response to needing economic info. But it seems more about political control than economics.

Speaker A: It's hard to see the upside of a police surveillance state since we value civil liberties. Like Jefferson said, the biggest threat is a standing army, eroding liberties to protect against unseen threats.

Speaker B: I saw China's COVID response with lockdowns. Their surveillance let them limit movement and spread. Here it varied state by state on observance. So cultural norms affect capabilities. The question is what capabilities we overlook by rejecting such surveillance.

Speaker A: Right, there are pros and cons to government interference and surveillance. We need to thoughtfully weigh civil liberties versus potential benefits. There may be wise balances between the two systems.

 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with the filler content removed:

``` One question I have for the group is, does more transparency between nations lead to more world peace? If there was more openness about military capabilities, is that good? The second question is, will there actually be more equal information between countries going forward, or will AI leaders like the US accelerate their informational advantage and therefore have more power in negotiations? 

I think the answer to the first question is yes. Complete transparency probably leads to peace, because then why do you need war? You just acknowledge your opponent's greater power. But the problem is hidden factors. When Russia invaded Ukraine, there were many issues they didn't foresee, like corruption, dysfunctional military, high Ukrainian morale and motivation. So in theory transparency causes peace, but irrational factors remain.

For example, Britain's naval superiority meant no major naval battles, because other nations knew they would lose. But if both sides have highly accurate war gaming and information, you know who will win ahead of time and avoid conflict. 

But doesn't that incentive keeping your capabilities secret if you're weaker? And if you know you'll win, wouldn't you still want to fight for principles or values? Like with Palestine - they rejected offers of peace because of deeper disagreements.

```
Speaker A: ISIS motivated by afterlife idea that changes how you interpret information or measure costs. Values lead to different outcomes. You could tune societal values over time by introducing AI content. That's happening with weaponization of social media. Or it's not just one way, it's also them to us. Maybe future is transparency in capabilities and greater culture through globalization and AI systems that help bridge divides.   

Speaker B: I hope we move to global level to solve challenges. Nation state model should fade. What about security of AI or AGI? Who secures and controls it? Like with military and infrastructure, cybersecurity is unsolvable problem, offense dominant. Scarce talent relative to problems.  

Speaker A: Is your point powerful AI systems are small code that can be stolen?

Speaker B: Yes, poor cybersecurity could undermine national security plans.
```

The fluff and tangents have been removed while retaining the core substantive conversation between the speakers. The edited version focuses only on the key ideas and topics without redundant dialog or filler.
 Here is the conversation with filler content removed:

```Speaker A: I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to, because the LLMs, you don't really have to break into them. People already have them. Maybe you mean like hacking them to do bad things you're not supposed to?

Speaker B: I mean, people have open access to open source LLMs, like llama Two by meta. But people don't necessarily have access to open AIs or anthropics unless they hack into them. If we get even more powerful AI that's scaled private sector or public sector critical, that's an order of magnitude or two less expensive to train and operate, is that like, in the guise of AGI, that is rogue? 

Speaker A: Part of that where your national defense planning becomes moot because of some cybersecurity threat, is that like, in the guise of AGI, that is rogue?

Speaker B: Or is that whether we're talking about AI based systems or any digital systems, including military, digital systems can be really easily undermined, right? Dario Amode from Anthropic said on a podcast with Dora Kash Patel on August Eighth, that any motivated, not any unmotivated and well resourced enough actor, like, for example, China, could hack into any of the frontier AI labs right now. It's maybe less about who gets the powerful AI first so much as who can control or secure it. But again, military wise, security is really important. It could just undermine all of these issues.

Speaker A: I don't think there's some magic secret sauce that can be stolen or pried loose from one of these ladders. These models are unartifact and general purpose enough. Dario's perspective - there are Industrial secrets but not science secrets.

Speaker B: There's billions of dollars of investment.  

Speaker A: But proprietary IP, these are not secrets in the form of either industrial or science. There are industrial secrets that anthropic has, for instance, that he calls compute multipliers. Essentially, it makes it cheaper to train a bigger model because you have algorithmic tricks. But essentially what you're stealing is the expense of creating this thing all the way. The goal of security at Anthropic is to make it more expensive to steal the model than to train it yourself. So it's not that there was a secret sauce, it's just that it used to be not beneficial to steal because you could just train it with enough compute and time. There's nothing that actually can be stolen, I don't think that's true.

Speaker B: Well, with scaling, it's not going to be $100 million. It's going to be a billion dollars to get the next generation.  

Speaker A: Let's discuss the mechanics of if it can be stolen. But I like this topic because I'm thinking about it like, would it be accurate to say the extent to which, say, your defense apparatus could be co opted in one fell swoop or subverted? Does that really just scale with how centralized those systems are? Is that why these nuke subs are so decentralized, is because you can't just hack in and control them remotely? Is that the kind of risk we have if a superintelligence manages our defense system, and that's a single point of failure in some capacity because it's now hyper centralized?

Speaker B: There's federated and centralized models. But ultimately, what I'm scared about is if the systems are scaled and there's failure, and that will happen with AI because AI is not 100% relevant. 

Speaker A: What do you mean by scale?

Speaker B: Let's say we start having AI systems increasingly adopted across society in more and more ways - electricity systems, autonomous vehicle fleets, supply chains, banking systems, etc. So the attack surface increases.

Speaker A: Okay, so when you say scale, you mean that we are using AI much more widely and broadly. The question is, does that create an additional surface of vulnerability?
```
 Here is the edited conversation transcript:

Speaker A: My education is based on adversarial machine learning. For every AI model, there is an adversarial attack to create some expected outcome. Someone well resourced or stubborn can create attacks for models, large or small. I think the exact attack input or data manipulation could be left in the secrets - like shutting off Texas's power. You could get a temporal advantage of weeks or months. 

Speaker B: It increases the attack surface. There's work on ways if you access the weights, to automatically discover adversarial attacks for any safeguards. You can ask it for new attack ideas. One could argue we could use it for defense too.

Speaker A: If you keep it closed source, attacks are invisible and you can't defend yourself. Is the counterargument that while attacks probe it, you don't know what's wrong, especially if it's closed source? Can we distinguish between cyber attacking an AI model versus using AI for a cyber attack? Because AI can analyze data, it can put up a good defense from multiple vectors. But attacking a model may not be a well formed idea. Accessing ChatGPT is not the same as a local model. Deployment is complicated. The system versus model are different. Cybersecurity is a known issue for corporate desires, AGI risks, and national power. There's a lack of expertise in education. It's relevant to train more STEM for cybersecurity, which has higher demand than supply.

Speaker B: The demand for cybersecurity talent is much higher than the supply.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: Many possible reasons for cybersecurity to be difficult. I want to talk about one point, which is a very interesting one, still on this cryptography topic, which is why maybe, does the attack vector increase more quickly than the defense vector? I do think in cryptography, we probably come up with a defense, at least if I were a cryptographer, after an attack or by thinking of an attack, then you think of how to defend against it, because you can't really think of a defense for something that doesn't exist. The defense comes with the attack always.

Speaker A: I see two big attacks on a large language model: you can steal the weights and now have a more powerful model yourself, or you can hack the model to get it to do stuff it wasn't meant to do. But I can think of a third attack: what if somebody trained an LLM and tuned it so that there are certain things that it's more likely to say or guaranteed to tell you? For example, for top generals, it's tuned to give specific thinking. 

Speaker A: That's like Stuxnet, which didn't immediately blow things up but slowly created issues over time. The idea of injecting subtle core information into systems could work for LLMs too. Being able to be compromised from the beginning is a major security vulnerability. You would want to train your own. Maybe poisoning is a defense against stealing weights, because how could you trust this LLM wasn't poisoned against you? I would want that.

Speaker A: You can intercept a model, change it subtly, and send it on so now they have a broken model. Maybe you can encode an attack in the weights. People respond: what if you quantize the model? 

That's the key content without the filler. Let me know if you would like me to edit any other transcripts in this fashion.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

This brings up an interesting concept about interpretability and defense. The worst case scenario is for an enemy nation to capture military code on one of these nuclear subs. You got the whole plan. Same with capturing the Enigma device during World War II. The exploit for people is very known - blackmail, threatening family, interrogation or torture. If models retain this uninterpretable capacity, and now you need to know something secret about how to access them, then is it possible that at some point the national defense strategy is stored in some absolutely uninterpretable weights of some model? We have no idea why we're doing it. 

I think, too, training AI models to get really good at defeating mechanisms deployed by other AI models is also training them to basically have the capacity to go rogue. Carl Sagan quote - the ability to deflect an asteroid away from Earth is the same as the ability to deflect an asteroid into the Earth. Training robot soldiers to hunt humans can be used against you. Can you really just train AI models to defeat national defense networks?

Something occurred to me - there's a risk profile related to the security of AI systems, especially generative AI systems for any high reliability application like defense. What if, in training bigger models on datasets including other generative models, we hit model collapse? We already have deployed systems where model collapse is possible - the idea that as you train more, the ability to regress onto something coherent becomes less viable. What if we see widescale usage of systems like AIP for military decision making, and then in 2025 it stops working or becomes much easier to exploit? 

That highlights the criticality of data. Synthetic data is differently useful than real data. With self-driving cars, we should have as little real data as possible of cars hitting people. Synthetic data is great for that. But it has weaknesses, whereas real data keeps feeding the system. I wonder with real data, if we keep training models on more of what's available, like the 0.5% of Internet data, can we better secure models? First, that seems like a lot of data to parse through and check for security.
 Here is the edited conversation without fluff:

```The threats come from poor data quality. Creating large scale competent models may always require national level resources. 

Nuclear proliferation is hard. But renting capable AI models is easy and cheap. The real barrier is obtaining quality training data.

Reproducibility of models is challenging. Adding a comma changes nothing. True reproducibility means identical data, model architecture and hardware. Training involves randomness - weights are initialized randomly, batches are selected randomly. You can't just press train and always get the same result. 

Like stable diffusion, each inference pass gives different outputs. There's art and science to achieving reproducibility.

Early ideas were that communicating 90% confidence differs from "I'm not really sure." But AI systems aren't good at communicating certainty like people naturally expect from collaborators. 

There's a risk of model collapse if humanity consumes too much AI generated content, unraveling our models of reality.```

 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: We love chunk food, right? We're just almost at time, and I want to give space for everyone to share things that were new ideas or stood out. We have a slack channel which is semi active, one place people can continue the conversation, host meetups. Chenen and I are trying to build software that helps transcribe and synthesize ideas. Our long term goal is to build a growing body of accessible ideas online that people engage with creatively. The hope is we can get more people talking, generate new ideas, have that as an ongoing conversation.

Speaker B: One thing that came up was how these things will get used first is in intelligence and information synthesis, which could prevent conflict with more mutual visibility, but also increases attack surface for cyber threats, which is a huge hole in the wall. We should have a session on cybersecurity. 

Speaker C: I liked the Psyops idea of how we're trusting LLMs for education and flourishing. Evaluating how good an LLM is, is to use another LLM, which enables poisoning attacks. The subtlety of that, deployed at scale over time, is crazy. It's like interacting with recommendation engines - they don't recommend what we want, but what meets their goals. 

Speaker D: I was interested in the autonomous yet law-abiding nature of a submarine crew. The internal culture that develops must be very rich. They make lists of questions and arguments when underwater, and deliver them when they surface.

Speaker E: I loved hearing about reducing gun violence in Oakland through mediation. Maybe AI could help with that.

Speaker F: It was interesting to hear about differences in interpretability as a cultural construct, reflecting military culture. Also how critical people see cybersecurity regarding AI.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Person 1: I'm generally not a fan of regulation. I moved from DC to San Francisco to avoid it. But Yolanda's point made me think maybe there's space for evaluation or testing of what people consider AGI. A "FDA stamp of approval" could increase consumer confidence and prevent issues like people putting cones on their Waymo cars. People talk about wanting "nutrition labels" for AI - transparency or regulation. Evaluations may be most critical, rather than interpretability or explainability. If people get that government stamp of approval, maybe they don't require interpretability. 

Person 2: I had a different misconception of what model collapse was. Thank you for explaining it.

Person 1: Yeah, so model collapse is like where does real knowledge come from? It's people reconsuming each other's output along with our senses of reality. So I don't know real data is necessarily better than data processed through some system. Or models through their conversations may become more capable - learn more, but get further from communicating with us. Our data becomes a smaller percentage of their capability. 

Person 2: If you've seen that compression technique called Shigelith or something - it compresses LLM outputs into gibberish for humans, but other LLMs can understand. There's a commercial product that does that - obfuscates so you don't leak internal data but can use external services. You give the gibberish and get the same response as before.

Person 1: That makes me think of a Manchurian candidate model weight - a sleeper agent inside the weights. You could do it steganographically - hide data in the weights. Good for floating point datasets.

Person 2: Steganography, that's the word.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Speaker B: I was heartened to hear that the military takes oversight, human oversight, seriously and wants transparency and reasoning behind decisions at every layer. 

Speaker A: In the military you practice things repeatedly. How many times do you have to drill for doing X before you're allowed to do X in the military? A lot of times. It's a rigor to practice something 100 times so it's natural the first time when you're under pressure. That thinking could be a helpful tool in other situations. 

One proposed regulation requires high risk systems have human oversight. What human oversight means is not substantiated much. How do you build a truly good human in or over the loop system? We have little phrases about human in the loop, but moving beyond that to have a collaboration between human and AI that is more aligned and robust isn't always clear. It would be interesting to understand the human in the loop system in the military that doesn't compromise efficiency but still has sufficient responsibility chain for defensibility and liability.

Speaker B: As a society we are unresilient and unprepared for cascading catastrophic events. 

Speaker A: Anyone else have closing thoughts? Well, thanks everyone for coming today. I'll make the recording available online. We have some smaller living room discussions coming up. On November 1 we'll have a much bigger discussion with up to 100 people where we can break into discussion circles and have a mini panel to share what was discussed. The theme is human flourishing, relating to personal development and wellbeing. It's on our calendar. If you subscribe you'll stay in touch. Joining our Slack is another way to get first notice of new events. Otherwise it's just a big list of names we might not recognize. If you want to get dinner nearby, there's restaurants in Hayes Valley. Or you're now free to go back to your lives. I'll set up over here if anyone wants to join Slack.

Speaker B: Yeah.

Speaker A: But sign up, it's good to have people. Still struggling with product market fit for an AI GRC startup. Most companies aren't looking for a GRC platform right now.

Speaker A: I'm Kwame. I work in the AI governance space, which is risk focused. But I've benefited from being around techno optimists with different views because it gives me a sense of the expansive possibilities from AI. Creativity is broader than artistic expression - it's fundamental to all we do. Does this partnership with Chachi BT expand or constrict my creativity? That's what I'm excited about.

Speaker B: I'm Asidra. I work as a software engineer. I got my master's in computational science from Georgia Tech and worked in natural language querying. I'm passionate about creativity because it makes life beautiful by enabling parallel thinking. I want to explore combining AI and creativity and hear others' opinions. 

Speaker C: I'm Joshua, a startup lawyer helping innovators move forward. My background is in data protection and I recently moved to San Francisco from Prague. The energy here is amazing - people are passionate about solving problems. I'm interested in developing beneficial AI systems. Books like Invisible Women show how biases can be created. I want to be part of the movement to prevent that. I studied AI's impact on creativity and copyright law regarding generated music. I'm curious what creativity means for building something meaningful.

Speaker D: You're enjoying San Francisco so far?

Speaker C: I'm loving the energy here.

Speaker E: I'm Ekaterina. I came to the United States about eight years ago for my master's. My bachelor's was in computer engineering. I've dabbled in creative pursuits throughout my life - I had a job writing jokes for a social media company. I've even written a book at some point and published short stories. I dabble a lot in creativity generally. Like, right now, I'm doing photography and stand up comedy. My general interest is around computational methods and how they can augment creative processes. I've built Twitter bots that create different tweets exploiting grammar to repeat specific patterns. With large language models, I'm interested in how that can scale and apply to other creative output.  
Speaker A: I've done community building work for founders and engineers in SF. Did this thing called Screwball Valley. I've been tinkering with projects, ideas, concepts, conversations about how the world's going to change economically and existentially. Creativity is a fun outlet. My ideal world would be taking away implications about economics and life - if I can think about it, I think it'll exist. Especially with a concept for a joke - minimizing those extra cycles of drafting is brutal. So there's just new forms of creativity from tech and genius music. Human expression is going to be the final thing to evolve. So pretty excited to see where things go.
Speaker C: I run a meme community. Every person is an AI software engineer. I create my own memes. I've looked into ChatGPT for connections, but it doesn't have a pulse on that. There is still a human touch for cultural elements. I'm curious about what culture means when everything is automated. What does culture look like with standardized writing? 
Speaker D: Are you embedded with the Web Three community as well? When you talk about memes, that's an inherent part of those communities too.
 Here is the edited transcript removing filler content:

Speaker C: I took some time off from working my whole career. I've been scaling communities. You get burned out on people.  I laid low for a while, but I'm back in the game now.

Speaker D: I was born in China, I grew up in the US. And then I've been working in Hong Kong for the past couple of years. I was in New York, Wall Street for most of my career, and then recently I moved into Web Three into crypto. I work at a centralized exchange called Crypto.com. My interest in the creative space, I like to write casually from time to time. I realized that's something that stayed with me throughout the years that I haven't been back in touch with writing. I still write from time to time, and people ask me to do certain things, and I'm always excited whenever I can contribute from that creative part of me. It's all the years of working in finance where there's just no ability to express yourself. My interest in Salon or AI - I've used it to just give me some ideas for brainstorming writing topics, and I've asked it to write stuff, and it's really good. I would say that a lot of the stuff that I used to write, if I just give it a certain level of prompting, it probably does it just as well, if not even better. I'm not intimidated, I'm not insecure. It's more like, how do I explore this now? How do I take my writing to another level? How do I explore what is creative because some of the stuff I've asked it to do, it's pretty creative. I'm just trying to understand as much as possible what AI is capable of and then fit it later.

Speaker F: I've been building the team for the last three months. We're working on autonomous interfaces for retail and small business to replace websites, to interact with people's personalized agents. In the future, websites won't be the same. You won't interact with them like a person would now. You'll use your personalized agent or autonomous systems to interact with websites. We're trying to do a shopify with turnkey solutions for retail and small business so that we can make these interfaces with use cases. I've been on this journey for six months. LLMs are only as good as your input and how well you can phrase what you're trying to get out of it. I needed a community to help build. I think it's hard to try to do anything on your own in any space. I feel like creativity will be outperformed and outproduced by all creative material being output. These agents and autonomous systems will have to decipher research, music, information for us, because how will the world look when there's ten times that amount being produced daily by things that aren't humans? 

Speaker D: Yeah.

Speaker A: Sorry, I missed your name.

Speaker F: Omar.

Speaker A: Omar. Nice to meet you.

Speaker D: My name is Kofi. I'm a Norwegian anthropologist, doing a PhD in anthropology.
 Here is the edited version of the transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker D: I'm interested in AI, chat bots and how people interact with them. I'm also interested in how this affects creativity and culture and mass production. Anastasia wrote about mass production of culture, factory production of art pieces back in the day. I use chatbots in my writing, both academic and for fun, prompting myself and asking if ideas and phrasings are good, co-editing with the machine. It makes me more productive but is it making me an editor rather than creator? Editing is creative but am I just editing my thoughts, having my own thoughts? Is this me doing this? I'm interested in culture and creativity. 

Speaker A: Thanks for introducing yourselves. 

Speaker D: Do you have WiFi?

Speaker A: Yes, here is the password.

Speaker F: I'm Joshua, a software and ML engineer. I write and bake.

Speaker C: I'm Joshua, a lawyer working with startups. I also play flute and saxophone and started two podcasts on law and technology.

Speaker D: What are the podcasts about?

Speaker C: Upskilling lawyers on technology.

Speaker A: Let's go around and introduce ourselves again - just names this time.

Speaker C: Kwame, Farte, Joshua, Ekaterina, Joshua, Hannah, Chen, Rin. 

Speaker A: We went over everyone's backgrounds. I wanted to start by getting on the same page about creativity, since that's key. People associate it with typical artifacts like drawing or music, but you can be creative in other ways. We could discuss how AI interacts with those pillars of creativity and mass production of culture. But there's also the creative process itself. Can AI be creative? Do we know what human creativity is? I'd love to hear someone's initial definition of creativity.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

```Speaker F: Creativity is using your imagination for any process - work, creating artifacts. It's changing the script, thinking differently about anything. 

Speaker D: I think of playfulness and imagination with creativity - creating, playing, coming up with new things.

Speaker C: For me creativity also comes from life experience, which gives us all different ways to evolve a concept. 

Speaker F: You need some experience to be creative.

Speaker D: Consciousness is creative. Life is creation. 

Speaker A: I associate creativity with intentionality. A lightning bolt creating a pattern isn't creative, even if it's artistic. The photographer finding and capturing it is creative.

Speaker D: You as the photographer are saying that pattern is art. You created it by finding it. AI lacks the consciousness to be creative.

Speaker F: There's a difference between artifacts and creativity - the lightning bolt is an artifact, not creative.

Speaker A: Right, the lightning bolt itself isn't a creative act to me. That's too broad a definition.

Speaker B: But don't creative ideas sometimes come when your intention was something else entirely? 

Speaker A: Yes, like Kwesi's dripped paintings - some control but also letting go. He mastered the technique but worked to relinquish control.

Speaker D: What about art where something surprising happens that you just go with? Is that found art?

Speaker A: It relates to Joshua's point about unintended ideas. 

Speaker D: We might have created it, found it, but our consciousness made it art.
```
 Here is the edited transcript with the filler content removed:

```
Speaker A: Does anyone think creativity increases value if human? We're coming to AI systems. Kofi did doves, quick doves. Leila in a moment, expensive. Clearly value isn't effort in moment. Maybe lifetime effort. 

Speaker D: Maybe uniqueness, like something that can't be recreated, has value. History of object, like painting it's image, history, canvas, frame. A 200 year old painting adds value but not creative process. 

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker D: Story is important. What's the story behind image?

Speaker A: Stories become currency for artifacts.  

Speaker D: Artifacts commodity now. Story is important.

Speaker F: I value AI creativity as much as human. Soon more valued. 

Speaker D: AI amazing. Knows art history, design, lighting, color. You don't.

Speaker E: Value Van Gogh for skill, inferiority, reflects who he was. Identify aspects. Don't care about model parameters. 

Speaker D: Kofi broke rules, impact. Don't like work but impact. Breaking rules interesting. Know rules to break them.

Speaker A: If random painter did Kofi, not creative. But understanding structure and combining in new way is. 

Speaker F: Still creativity if no idea what doing. Culture shifting how defined. Most don't value AI yet but will.

Speaker A: Ideas of artifacts like logos associated with creativity will shift. AI can create endlessly, so no longer creative output. Just a logo factory.
```
 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript with the filler content removed:

```Speaker D: It's a story from a science. Buy into that story. Otherwise, just pixels. I wanted to touch upon intentionality experience story again, this thing about knowing the artist or the artist in the creation of an art piece. There's something about that story about the artist as well. But then maybe you can think of the people who made the AI as the kind of people you can think about the teams behind that and their creativity. I don't know. The levels of nuance. 
Speaker A: I don't think it's a story. I think it's the case that human machine teams do better. Soon that won't be the case. But it is the case right now for chess.
Speaker D: Chess?  
Speaker E: I thought the machines are quite already better. 
Speaker A: Yeah. I think right now this might have changed in the last year. Human chess hybrid teams, they outperform the best chess machine on its own. I mean, the human is still using the best. 
Speaker C: Sorry.
Speaker D: With chess again, I'm trying to translate it into art and why we value art and creativity. I don't know about you guys, but it's kind of boring watching two computers play chess against each other, right. But then when you include the teams, suddenly it's like engaging again. So thinking about AI generated art, we might just find it kind of boring.
Speaker A: I feel like this thread of what do we value? And this storyline thread is really about the artifacts. What do we call art, how do we value them? That's a bit different than the creative process in general. I don't think the creative process is merely a story. I think the creative process is something. It doesn't have to be human, specifically human. I'm just trying to understand what are the components of that process that need to be there. And maybe some of you are happy to say that if a bunch of billiard balls came together and bounced in different directions, that's creativity to me, that doesn't sit completely right. I posit, unintentionality. It doesn't need to be like a perfect goal. And I don't think that intentionality needs to necessarily be human. But I put that out there as, like, being some partner. I would love to hear, are there other parts that you think are necessary before you want to call something creativity? Or is any new creative output, whatever is the creation of that? Are you willing to call creativity?
Speaker F: You would go back to dig deeper into consciousness. Then what do you define as consciousness? We can go there because, consciousness is intentionality to create anything. But consciousness is deep because we don't understand. Consciousness is a tree, conscious is a rock.
Speaker D: Consciousness but I don't see anybody addressing a machine can be self aware, not be what we are, for sure. 
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker D: So what is that? Still alien?
Speaker E: No, what is that?
Speaker D: So there's this idea of consciousness or sensei. If somebody knocks me out and I have no data in or out, but I'm still human, still perception.
Speaker A: I think perception is really the key there for all this is consciousness, right?  
Speaker D: Maybe we need a new word for it and a better definition. There's a difference between being self aware and conscious. I don't know the words are.
Speaker F: People can't define consciousness as much as they can define I mean, when we define consciousness, then you can define creativity. But people don't have a definition.
Speaker D: For.
Speaker A: Rick Rubin has this book called The Creative Habit, and I spent a couple of years just deep diving, trying to find neurological reasons, how to be more creative, how to be more productive and all that stuff. 
Speaker D: That book's magic.
```

The key things I tried to remove were filler words, repeated phrases, tangents, and excessive dialog that did not move the core conversation forward. I aimed to retain all the substantive dialog and ideas, just tightened up by removing the fluff. Let me know if you would like me to edit the transcript further.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation with filler content removed:

Speaker A: We discovered Rubin a couple of years ago for this book. It's about being open to reception via the ether. It's like some Pragmatic stuff where you listen and calm your mind down and just let those sounds overlay the sound of a random thing outside that comes musically or something. I'm taking a lot of things out of context here.

Speaker D: How many people have read the Rick Rubin book? 

Speaker F: I heard of it.

Speaker B: I wanted to have Creative Habit by Twilight Harp. 

Speaker A: Surprised I've only read a tiny book by John Cleese on the creative process, which was also, like ten minute read. The last word is he basically quotes taste the difference. 

Speaker D: Did you recommend it? It was great.

Speaker A: Let me try to remove intentionality and relate to this point - it's actually very difficult to bring into life new things that are worthwhile in some way, worthwhile for humanity. It's not going to be throwing billiard balls together to get useful things out. The occasion when lightning strikes is very rare. It's difficult to set up the situation, to create new things that are worthwhile.

Speaker D: That thing about lightning strikes me.

Speaker A: Let me try and make it less artistic and subjective and talk about the creativity of science or engineering where you're taking a lot of creativity to add something to our capabilities as humanity, our engineering might, our control over the world. That is a creative process. It's nontrivial to add on to that capability. I made a system without intentionality or consciousness that was able to just create new scientific discoveries, new engineering things, I would say that's a creative machine. It has no intentionality, but it is able to see new relationships, new worlds, and create new things. Does that strike true?

Speaker C: Maybe it's creating creative outputs, but is it expression? 

Speaker A: We haven't talked about the word expression. We could now because...

Speaker C: I think that's the distinction - you can create new ideas, look at what is currently existing to create something new. But what makes us human is what we've experienced and what we've seen before and how we build something new. Maybe that human quality really makes it. 

Speaker A: Ekaterina brought up the phrase "the reflection of its interiority" which doesn't need to be human. As soon as you think something has an interiority to express, when you see the creative output as a reflection of that interiority, in my fake science machine, that's a creative thing expressing a certain interiority. It has a sense of how the world works that it's able to bring things together, but it's not reflecting anything human.

Speaker D: This is very heady for me, be fun. I thought this would be an art meeting to find out what people's experience in life is, where they are with art, what is their human experience with art? What's your humanity with art?
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with the filler content removed:

Speaker A: We covered this a bit as just some people here are musicians or hobbyist musicians. Hannah has previously ran a social group around meme creation and is interested in just bringing communities. So I draw and I play guitar. But sorry, we're not going to go through it again.
Speaker C: What do you do?  
Speaker D: Why? What can I journey?
Speaker F: That's why art is on your brain.
Speaker D: I love color, I love Jason. And story is more and more important.
Speaker A: Yeah. And I want to keep the conversation because I think creativity often immediately becomes an art conversation and I just want to keep it a little higher level for now. And then we can kind of go into kind of more specific verticals of creativity.
Speaker D: I guess want to go back to the human experience thing that seems there and intentionality as well. And interiority. Is it only humans that can be creative? Or can animals be creative? Is a beaver creative? Or is it just an automaton building dams? But it's also not every river is the same. So it's not building the same dam over and over again. Why would there be a dichotomy? Why would it be a barrier? Why would it be a continuum? So I guess if we are willing to say that animals have some kind of creativity, then maybe machines can have some kind of creativity that's not the same maybe as ours, but it's creative. We're getting confronted by meaning of life. 
Speaker A: Do we to maybe because I'm sure we could stay on this topic for literally ever. How do we feel about Pragmatically for the rest of the conversation? When we talk about creativity here, we're talking about Lynn Cole's original definition, which is the capacity to bring kind of new things to life or connect new ideas. That kind of thread. And when we talk about expression, we'll use that phrase to add on this additional component of reflecting some interiority of some kind. And I know that's still a bit vague, but does that feel like we're at the 80% of capturing definitions? 
Speaker F: The human conversation of perception of production versus like beaver world or tree world consciousness of the earth, but more so like human productivity adding to that next level, that's what we're narrowing it in on human creativity.
Speaker A: I'm just trying to separate the capacities for creation creativity and creation that reflects some kind of interiority, which I'm calling expression. And those can be valued differently. And we might think different things about how AI can relate to those, how we relate to AI for the purpose of creativity versus expression, etc.
Speaker F: I guess just on that line of thinking, my thoughts are that there's going to be emerging culture that we can't even imagine yet as far as creative scientific developments that are going to happen and new forms of even art or production that we can't really imagine yet, but humans won't be able to replicate. So our value of human production and culture is going to kind of shift over the coming years and decades to maybe value these autonomous systems idea of making things new for us. I guess I'm trying to visualize it in my head. It's like a shift in culture. 
Speaker D: We're the consumers, though. We're the ones that decide until AI takes over. Right now, we're the consumers.
Speaker A: Have most of us watched the movie Her?
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker A: I'm rewatching a film. There's a part where a woman shows a film she made of her sleeping mother. By today's standards it's bad art, but in that context it was her interpreting and showing something human and real - her relationship with her mom. People around her were confused, questioning why she was showing this. But it was along a trajectory of people figuring out how to grapple with a world where human creative output is becoming less relevant.

Speaker B: Interested in exploring that point further. If logo creation becomes something AI does utilitarianly, does that change the definition of art? Or is it just pixels? 

Speaker D: Life is creation. AI can provide materials like a logo with design history, but I'm the creator, the storyteller. AI gives me tools but I make the art.  

Speaker E: We already buy mass produced furniture versus local craftsmen. We value ease of production. That will continue with AI created art. But with memes, intentionally downgrading quality or context is the point. Perfect production misses the point.

Speaker A: That's like the film - the importance is it's "mine", not that it's quality.

Speaker C: Yes, memes must be low quality pixelated to work. I've tried automating meme creation with ChatGBT but it misses contextual relevance. Not sure that can be automated. 

Speaker A: You were called out earlier - go ahead.

Speaker C: I have pragmatic thoughts...
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: My assumption is there will be a point where we have daily, hourly, minutely updated AI systems. I assume the failures you're seeing seem like failures that will be improved upon over time.

Speaker D: Memes mean, viruses replicate, create, things trying to replicate.  

Speaker C: There are two aspects of memes - intellectual and visual. The visual is easily replicated but the context and placement can't be automated. 

Speaker A: Before GPT, simpler models created idioms that felt like genuine insight. Memes are probably like horoscopes - vague but evocative, meaning comes from interpretation.

Speaker C: I make customized memes so I’m neurotic about it. But Peppy the Frog means something different to millions. Would Chat GPT explain Pepe accurately?

Speaker A: As an AI model, I cannot comment on that.

Speaker C: To boil it down - there’s a scale of conscious creation to tangible impact under the assumption everything is human made. But with AI, it becomes two axes - human versus AI creations. Then there are quadrants of what’s acceptable or accurate in society. If AI creates impact without human intent, is that still worthwhile? More than a human creating alone? 

Speaker D: What gets things worth? 

Speaker C: That’s a great question.

Speaker A: Scarcity, I think.

Speaker C: Worth as in tangible impact, which is objective.

Speaker D: Human experience, a monetary quantity.

Speaker A: There’s a difference.

Speaker C: My meme community means a lot to some people. Does that make it not worthwhile? Not all memes are automated. Would AI memes have the same impact? Would people care?

Speaker D: Well, maybe.

Speaker A: The rubber hits the road in how much output is you versus the system. Do I as system creator have creative rights or monetary rights? Can I shut it down? These are legal questions.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: I love that because it actually gives some structure around how you define creativity. But it's also very reminiscent of how the law defines copyright. For something to be protected by copyright, it needs to be human made. Even under US law, it explicitly says it cannot be machine made, it's not copyrightable, and there needs to be substantial effort. 

Speaker D: What is that substantial?

Speaker C: And then what is that?

Speaker E: Fair use sort of hinges on that, right?

Speaker C: But now when I was looking into generative music, this was where I got caught up on because I was like, why does the law require it to be human when actually the output could be the same? 

Speaker F: If a human put the prompt in that they made it or no?

Speaker A: Well, that's a wide word. And would that be substantial effort? Maybe if I showed a recording of me going like this for an hour and then I typed the prompt, then you'd be like, that was substantial effort. But if I just sat down on my computer and then just went like this, then maybe that's not I don't know if these are the ambiguities that.

Speaker D: So are you working on the legalities of this?

Speaker C: Yeah, so I work with startups as a lawyer. 

Speaker D: Oh, nice.

Speaker C: So it comes up quite a lot with the transformative quality. For example, if you're training an LLM, if you're putting in copyrighted data and what's coming out is what you've actually then is the output. Is that something that you can then claim have copyright over even though it's from copyrighted material and under the law it's transformative. So in theory, yes, you can then protect that because you've created something new from it.

Speaker E: It's like a photocopy of a paper, a new paper.

Speaker D: How much? How do you quantify that exactly?

Speaker C: But I think even the legislators, they haven't considered how things are changing over time, like how big of a step that technology is taking.

Speaker D: I'm just question about the prompts. I imagine right now, my understanding is no, prompt is not copyrighted. You got to put it in photoshop. You have to take your image and put in Photoshop and make some shape. 

Speaker A: No, it will take the output the current state.

Speaker D: It's also stupid. Okay, sorry. When online creating first happened, you couldn't had me typewriter. What the guy did is he made a typewriter, he made a computer that typed and that was acceptable. So right now I could set up a computer that took my excuse my French, whatever, I'm not going to say took my image from mid journey, put it in Photoshop, automated it, changed it. And then I'm like, I didn't do any of it. But it's legality. Legalized fans. I don't have to tell Court that I do anything. But I went to photoshop. I mean, it's stupid. Sorry.

Speaker C: No, it's like the law will always be behind. But this is something that I was thinking about, like how there is definitely.

Speaker D: Going to be cases that come up quite my right.

Speaker C: Well, I kind of want to come back to AI systems against humans. And I firmly believe we always create existing systems. But why is the digital system much more threatening and talked about? To be fair, it's much more advanced and not the same as the US.

Speaker E: Government.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker D: Every innovation goes through backlash. Illustrators lost jobs when digital came out. Now those people do digital art. The thing about copyright is interesting - who made this? Historically copyright is confident - Walt Disney took fairy tales for generations, no one worried whose stories were these. He takes them, freezes them in copyright, owns them now even though based on generations. What's interesting legally - it's all about money. Disney will break path. Stay in the wave behind them, you'll be fine. Creativity is systems - am I part of a historical system with people and ideas before me I mash together and make something new? That's life.

Speaker A: Let me be a copyright optimist - we want to incentivize creation, assume some protection benefits innovation. But there's regulatory capture - Disney example doesn't help Snow White. Winnie the Pooh enters public domain, people make new things - different perspectives. We're in a system with constraints - how do we move copyright? What system of responsibility and payment will best allow us to create beneficial things? What allows human-AI collaborations to support us moving forward?  

Speaker F: Still a question of money and access - better systems only you access. Monetary value, how much you assign to production. So still money driven.

Speaker A: Free market people say money is the incentive structure to create beneficial things - each person cares about money, but overall system cares about making good things for humans. Money is the abstraction of what people value, the driver of production. 

Speaker F: That's utopian - would already happen if possible. More driven by money now like always. Won't become optimistic view of making things better.

Speaker A: Money is the thing that drives production, not that people are money driven. It's the coordination device.

Speaker D: Right.

Speaker A: Yeah, the coordination to make new things.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker F: If that's the case, we would be like the Jetsons 50 years ago. We could have had the possibilities to have so much technology that's been suppressed, but it's not to make things better. It's just been money overarching.  

Speaker A: Well, one response is free market needs additional structure like regulations, standards, or cultural soft law. You propose a radical future where AI systems unmoored from human drivers promote creative expression. I still want to hear how humanity benefits from human creative.  

Speaker D: How to have humanity flourish?

Speaker A: We want to create things that help humans or sentients.

Speaker D: Can you restate the question? 

Speaker A: One goal for society is to advance human or sentient flourishing. We want things that best help replicate life.

Speaker F: I want to hear from others first.  

Speaker A: Do others want to weigh in?

Speaker B: I think giving you more time to focus on what you're good at, using AI to edit, etc, so you spend time on ideas not every word. Still creator of ideas, more seamless process.  

Speaker D: Yeah, saving time, but struggle is valuable in itself. Learning the hard way before automating can be good to understand how things work. But society judges art by the pain and process, not product. My pain is personal, stay out of that. Let's talk about the work itself. But how do humans flourish?

The key points and flow of the conversation are retained while removing excessive filler words, redundant dialog, tangents, and fluff. Only minimal edits were made to tighten up the transcript. The substantive content and ideas of the original conversation remain intact.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: I'm taking let's be utilitarian - there's something in each of our heads moving society forward. Astra you brought up, AI human collaboration can support us allowing most of us to spend more time in our strengths. When we've used Chat GPT, we've experienced this - it helps get through blank page problem. People talk about software engineers having their rubber ducky to bounce ideas off of. The thing we have to bounce ideas off of now is insane. It collaborates back and forth. Maybe it projects us into a narrowed creative space, though. Maybe through that bounce, we don't bounce everywhere. We bounce into the attractor space of ChatGPT's output. Maybe that's not great. Maybe we would be better with a rubber ducky. But your point is one of the optimistic ways. 

Speaker D: Of allowing people to ignite our creativity or brainstorm or provide structure.

Speaker A: Astra brought up the idea powerfully - I'm really good at ideas. I've heard it's the age of the ideas guy now. Because if you have an idea but you're not good at marketing copy, I don't have to care anymore. I just say, Go write marketing copy. 

Speaker D: I've been thinking about this - GPT can write code now. You don't need to learn Python or do well in programming classes. But to appreciate what GPT can do, you need to be a good programmer yourself. What I've noticed in writing is I can tell GPT, this is not insightful. I'm disappointed in you, but this is a good addition in terms of insight. I like how you combine techniques. But combining that is elementary. I feel it helps us be smarter, but we shouldn't vacate our creative or productive process either. We still have to know well.

Speaker A: Akhil brought this up - the one fundamental aspect of creativity is taste. I think that's kind of what you're saying.

Speaker D: Taste, as in good taste in things? That's beautiful.

Speaker A: When you become a PI in science, what value do you add? Sometimes it seems you just talk to people. Main thing PI's develop is scientific taste - they can quickly grasp interesting vs uninteresting directions. That happens at all scales - you're talking about at the scale of these are interesting. 

Speaker D: That is intuition.
 Here is the conversation with the fluff removed:

```Speaker D: Intuition comes from experience. With AI, I can go through exploring one style in a day and be done. There's going to be as much exploration of art this year as the last thousand. This is how you get intuition - do it, do it, do it. 
Speaker C: Same thing.
Speaker D: Ilia sits cover is the only one with an intuitive feel for GPT. It helps you learn so much faster. I can ask it questions at a deeper level than experts. It understands where my gap was earlier and addresses that. Whether it's creativity or knowledge, you build intuition from experience. Has anybody read Finnegan's Wake with ChatGPT? I would never read that on my own.
Speaker E: He invented words not in English. Rick Rubin doesn't play instruments. His point is he knows what good music sounds like, but that's about the mainstream. I think the explosion of ChatGPT risks homogenizing taste.  
Speaker D: We'll have as much art evolution this year as the last thousand. Homogenization won't be a problem. Artists will go crazy. Just explore, make art, experience, share. I heard someone spend half a podcast saying they want to be an artist - just be one. Show your creations, don't talk about it.
Speaker A: My question was about governance structures to flourish with AI. This became a different question about how AI already supports or doesn't support. We don't have to dive into that.
```

Speaker F: I think you could piggyback on no matter how much people are producing more, they think they're doing better. That's not the question. I think democratizing acknowledgment of that thought is the answer to a regulation of how do you move the ball forward. Because then no matter how much or less people are producing individually, an AI system to recognize everyone individually, their thoughts and accomplishments could then democratize moving forward collectively versus one person that stands out that shouldn't. If you democratize the acknowledgment of everyone's thoughts, that's going to take to a degree, a bit of privacy away or freedom, but it would also move the ball forward outside of a monetary system.

Speaker A: Let me restate this. Any creative accomplishment was built upon innovations by billions of people. And we do not properly thank and give credit to those people through money we give them and their recognition. Instead, we simplify this is the great man. 

Speaker D: What are they given? What's their experience being recognized?

Speaker A: Let me finish. One possibility now is that in the generation of art, we can potentially inform its creation and try to understand its origin in terms of the data, people, and person that prompted it. Everything is a societal thing. Maybe we should recognize people who contribute an interesting thing that is the next thing that everyone buys. Web 3 acknowledgment and coordination.

Speaker D: I identify with what you said. As I hang out with entrepreneurs, I see China has developed at this breakneck pace. You only see the success stories now. You don't see the human toll this level of development has created. There are so many entrepreneurs who lost their shirts, who had incredible ideas but were bankrupt. 

Speaker A: In science, there are people not recognized who eventually someone puts the pieces together in a transformative way. You're not just standing on the shoulders of giants, but of a mass of people that hold up. 

Speaker D: It's like a bunch of people and then this one guy rises to the top and becomes the symbol.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker D: Representative was term one German scientist introduced - denkgemenchaft or thought fellowship. One laboratory is like thought fellowship or one department or one university or community of universities around world. It's all part kind recognizing you're standing on shoulders of not only giants but also everyone around you, all your colleagues. It's a fellowship. 

Speaker A: I've decided to allow the era and culture of DeLorean.

Speaker D: But I just wanted to introduce that term. Do it in what you want.

Speaker A: Like thought fellowship. 

Speaker D: Yeah.

Speaker A: And I love the idea of the because the world is a thought. The world is so maybe one of the structures I've never been positive about anything Web Three, but one of the things that does seem worthwhile is to allow and maybe can separate us from our selfish needs to not just create but also get recognition for the creation. Right. There's a conflict right now with like, yeah, I want to make that, but I also want to make sure that I get the credit for it. And if I could just trust that I would get the credit that the AI system that makes the stuff, like, if it's using my music or whatever, would filter down to me having a life or whatever, I could become freer in being created.

Speaker D: It's all blockchain technology. You're almost speaking to the as if you're part of the gospel. Yeah, idea of decentralized ownership of people being paid for. That's what NFTs are. You can track the royalties and commission. Continue to digitally because there's a footprint and then it's verified and no middleman or music producer can siphon these funds. Idea is that blockchain will achieve that. But I think it's a separate argument. 

Speaker A: And it seems kind of important given that one conversation that we haven't had right now, which I think is fine, is what's going to happen to the jobs of creative people. Like real thing where some people respond, creatives always happens. There will be new creative people and they're like dismiss this concern. But there's a possibility that while there are still creatives in the future, current group who allowed this next step to happen are not part benefiting from that next stage because maybe they're not useful anymore. You don't need logo designers anymore because logo design commodified. Wouldn't it be nice if those previous logo designers could be recognized for their contribution into that? Long standing debate, not just Creative, but if you're the laborers at Google.

Speaker D: Guess the argument is you get paid while you're there. The very capitalistic view of things is you get paid for the utility that you bring in for the next minute or the next hour. 

Speaker A: I think the response there is clearly there was some amount that could have been paid to you for your labor that instead of reserved for R and D efforts to automate you. 

Speaker D: It'll be complex incentive.

Speaker A: No, but yeah, I'm trying to say there is this general point about trying to Future allow recognition and AI systems. 

Speaker D: The really thing about recognition as an artist, what I want, I want to be able to give them. I want people to know what I can create. I don't really care about them. I mean, the money's okay. I don't really care. You copy it all you want. I just want to play more. I want recognition, and people want to. I don't give a crap about acknowledgement. I want to create more other people.

Speaker A: Minimum, they need to be able to put food on the table.

Speaker D: Yeah, UBI. And what is the end game? Once AI is doing everything we need, what are we going to do? Play and create. And then that's what is art. It's playing, it's fun, it's creation.
 Here is the edited transcript removing filler content:

Speaker E: But there's inherently something about life itself, like a drive for existence beyond just money. 

Speaker D: Money is only good money. It's a representation of our desire.

Speaker A: In an early AI salon, one question was, in a future where AI systems can do everything, there's a possibility of a dearth of meaning for people. Maybe artists who just want to play are fine. But others who got meaning from improving reality suddenly lack meaning. One idea was humans play status games independent of anything else. So we'll feel fine like aristocrats in the 1600s because our needs are met but we're still playing status games. If I created core AI music systems, I'd want that status of you knowing. 

Speaker D: I don't care if people know. I want to create. I always wanted this. Connections, not public status, got me here. Don't you think the need for recognition is culturally constructed? Future people might not have the same need. 

Speaker A: Joshua's talking about a lovely future where people don't feel that need but still bring meaning through art or science.

Speaker D: There's room for scientists to improve humanity with psychedelics without sacrificing lives. I'm skeptical on no need for recognition because our brains want it.

Speaker A: Let me say before people head out - we have a calendar to subscribe to for AI salon events. They get 50-100 people signing up so we want repeat visitors but can't guarantee every event. Every 6 weeks or so we'll do larger less intimate events for more people, especially if you've been to one before to help out. Let us know if you have other ideas or want to host. Akil, Joshua, thank you for coming!

Speaker D: Thank you!

Speaker A: We could host two 20 person events at once in the future which would be great. I'm also working on a potential huge music hackathon partnership. I bought the domain outsidelensX.com. 

Speaker D: Music hackathon? 

Speaker F: AI music?

Speaker A: I want to see Midjourney for music.

Does this edited version retain the core content while removing fluff? Let me know if you would like me to modify the edit further.
 Here is the edited version with fluff removed:

Speaker F: I know. The enterprises are really close, too. You're competing with people with dumb billions at the same problem.
Speaker D: The journey is 35 people.  
Speaker A: Friendships are better than enterprise.
Speaker C: What's the outside land?
Speaker D: What's your website?
Speaker C: It's my card. 
Speaker C: Wait. Wow. It's my Tarot card. My textbook tarot card.
Speaker D: Did you say Tarot cards?
Speaker C: Yeah. I don't want to how many do you have? Not the correct one for the person for now. Yes, I'm working.
Speaker D: That's nice.
Speaker A: I don't think I'm not the fool, but I was given the fool, so I'll have to think about it for a bit. Maybe I'll interpret as the gesture. Shakespearean.
Speaker C: Let us head out right now. It's nice to meet you, too.  
Speaker A: Hello, Hanu. Did you have a good, good. I'm glad no one here was too allergic to cats. 
Speaker C: This has been really interesting to me because I wrote this essay around five years ago on this topic and a lot of the topics that have come up today in the discussion is actually how the essay went. I want to go and read it again because also this concept around copyright and actual recognition, that was the conclusion I came to. I was just kind of trying to grapple with, why do we even have this structure? Who is it there to serve? And it was around the time, Ed Sheeran was also like, Just take my music. I don't  
Speaker D: Was his lawsuit, right? Yeah, which he won eventually.
Speaker C: In the past, he was very open. He was like, oh, it's music. I want you to have it. I don't mind about the rights. The fact that you're listening to it is my recognition.
Speaker D: This is your point. Everything is built on everything else, right? Everything's built on other ideas. I study anthropologies. I kind of always bring this thing about everything being culturally and historically very specific, and this idea of copyright as well, because anthropologists have studied societies where they don't really have this idea of ownership that Westerners tend to.  
Speaker A: My understanding is, at one point, in some cultures, the best hunter would sometimes be insulted and when they would get smaller, because it was very important for no individual to kind of feel way higher than the rest of society.
Speaker D: So it's like these are like small societies, but it's like just like it's sometimes helpful to think that things can be radically different than how we already live, right? How we already imagined the world to be. Even though it might not be radically different, because we have these very pat.  
Speaker F: I'm just curious of a society where it actually is different, where acknowledgment of anything you does not matter. I don't know of any societies like that.
Speaker D: No, I don't think the because I think there is some kind of acknowledgment.
Speaker A: Anyways, at minimum, if you bring back the meat many times over, I'm sure.  
Speaker F: Send him.
Speaker B: There's also a certain amount of privilege involved when you are considering the discussion of recognition, because Ed, Shereen will be like, okay, take my music, because he can afford it. Yeah, he's popular and he has the money, but that's the only means for their living. Recognition is important to them. Creation is important.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation with filler content removed:

Speaker A: I don't mean this to be a humble brag, but I've gone to kind of elite institutions and throughout my life, I have not felt a need to prove myself. I had an inherent self confidence. And that self confidence might have existed regardless of these. Or it might be that because I had early badges of your good, I had the luxury of not worrying about recognition. There's this book called Advice to a Young Investigator. And one question early on was like, how do I know if I can be a good scientist? The way the guy answered was like, well, first, read all the literature in your field, which of course was possible back then, and then try up until last year and then come up with ideas about what is not known and then see if real scientists today are trying to do that or try to replicate some of the work that's done. My point is recognition is valuable to give you some feedback on whether it's worthwhile to continue to pursue this thing. We are not so perfect in our understanding of ourselves. It might be helpful for me to know that I draw and I play guitar, but when I've drawn trees and shown those trees to people, they like those trees a lot more than my figure drawing. Now, does that mean I should give up on figure drawing? I don't know. But it's signal in the world that maybe I should pursue this tree thing more. 

Speaker D: You mean recognition isn't just a status game, it's also signal about if you're doing the right path?

Speaker C: Absolutely.

Speaker D: I think earlier I was saying skeptical, but it's great that he just goes out and produces stuff. But in society you notice there are layers and tiers, and there is a drive to attain certain benefits. That drives 90% of people and maybe 10% do it because they love the work.

Speaker E: Even that is tied to your sense of identity. The status games thing reminded me of Elon Musk challenging Zuckerberg to a wrestling match. When you have so much money, what do you end up doing? 

Speaker A: While listening to a podcast about that cage fight, I did not think it would come up here. 

Speaker D: We're saying that's a status thing?

Speaker E: I think it's also about identity, how you want to be. 

Speaker A: For these two people living in a post scarcity world, what makes them go? Especially for Zuckerberg, he needs new challenges to overcome. His are physical challenges. For Musk, I don't know, he's just trolling. Yeah, that's one way to think about it.

Speaker D: You said you've gone to elite institutions and made the point that you don't feel you needed recognition. 

Speaker A: I've never doubted my worth.

Speaker D: You've never doubted your worth. That's interesting because then we can take class into the picture. There's this lightness of being that comes with privilege. 

Speaker A: Yeah, it's like white men not feeling they identify as a man or white. It's like I'm just a person.

Speaker D: I'm just a person. Because you have the privilege to just be a person, but then people who struggled their way up really want that recognition.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker F: It's not inherent of class. I think as someone struggling with a startup, to have that value is not inherent. It's not something class. It's easier to be born into and feel that way, but it's not real, maybe.

Speaker A: I wasn't trying to make a cartoon of my own sense of self worth. There are people who have had the same upbringing that I have and gone to elite institutions and doubt themselves. I'm just trying to point out it makes it easier. It makes it easier to pretend like it might not be that important when you already have those validations. 

Speaker D: You've already got validation.

Speaker A: I have those validations I had them.

Speaker F: Those validations can come, I guess, is what I'm saying.

Speaker D: Yeah, sure.

Speaker A: I'm just bringing out one feature. You're bringing out another feature of this?

Speaker D: At our firm previously, we love to hire people who have PhDs instead of philosophy. Doctor of Philosophy stands for poor, hungry and driven. There's a certain comfort, it doesn't quite resonate as much like the hard work and what it takes.

Speaker B: To your point is, the pain of writing. And it's making the process more.

Speaker A: I'm not sure except in a truly equal world, where we do not need any coordination amongst people if it would even be desirable. Because one of the things that's helpful about people being pushed by status or money or whatever else some currency is that we as a national government, a global government, a larger community can have some control over moving as one humanity organism rather than a bunch of individuals. We can have group goals. And that coordination comes from status or money or whatever, a bunch of other things. Think about climate change. Carbon taxes are even possible because people have incentives driven by the system and that allows us to have access to this thing, carbon taxes. If we all were just driven by ourselves, we would have to make people care. You should care. It's probably easier to coordinate by saying, actually, if you want to be high status or buy your mansion, whatever, you should care. So maybe there's a reason to actually maintain some status, some currency. 

Speaker D: But yeah, some currency, some value.

Speaker A: Something that could be anything.

Speaker D: Yeah, totally. It doesn't have to be money. 

Speaker A: That's what I just mean anything that people generally recognize that is fungible. I mean, I think that's what money is.

Speaker D: But it could be like you have different systems in our society. We have an economic system, a class system, I guess people with money. I'm trying to get that there is in the Indian caste system, there's a different value. There's, like a spiritual value that makes certain individuals more worth than and I'm totally not in that society. I don't want to step in. 

Speaker A: Well, you took a dangerous step.

Speaker D: Okay, finish your thought. But anyway, there is some other value other than money that makes you have status. In that society sure.

Speaker A: From my perspective, potentially serves a worse coordination value, because it's not I'm going to close this. I would just love to spend a minute if you want to gather your thoughts. I would just love to hear what is a thought that you resonated with during this discussion? Maybe it's a thought that came up in your mind that you haven't had a chance to share anything like that. Just like takeaways I would love to hear so take a little bit of time, talk, whatever.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker F: I wanted to explore legality and how AI will outpace regulation soon. How will legality matter when regulation isn't keeping up with advancements? It's interesting for society to have a system to regulate advancement. Even though privacy rights are controversial, the idea of coordinating access to everyone's thoughts is interesting.  

Speaker A: There's a ton of work happening around AI governance. It's moved faster than response to any technology, but still might not be fast enough.

Speaker C: I think governance can move faster than regulation. Regulation has many layers. Big tech and VCs in Europe sent an open letter opposing the AI Act, saying it will slow innovation. The AI Act just passed and will restrict AI use cases. The feeling is regulators don't understand the tech or appropriate boundaries. Governance may be better to address issues as they arise. The conversation on co-ownership and contribution was thought provoking. Our system rewards individual contribution over joint ownership.  

Speaker A: The credit issue was my biggest takeaway. If we can solve that, it solves other problems. It provides an abundance mindset. It captures the ideology of true Web 3 people beyond the hype cycle. I'll have to ponder that.

Speaker D: I was curious about your thoughts on the speaker from Capgemini at Shaq 15. He was saying Europe knows what it's doing and is developing, innovating, and coming after Silicon Valley.

Speaker C: They're trying to stay competitive, but the AI Act seems rushed without considering if the current system is right going forward.

Speaker D: It's 600 pages! 

Speaker C: The way it's written feels outdated given how quickly things are changing now.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker D: I wanted to talk more about culture stuff. I'm interested in how mass production of art has happened similarly to what Anastasia wrote about. What is art? Where does this take us? I'm a PhD student, so I want to read and discuss academic texts. What's your focus in anthropology?
Speaker A: I'm a cultural anthropologist interested in how people relate to AI and chatbots. 
Speaker D: Culture industry is about how everything becomes automated, like with Marvel movies rehashing the same thing over and over. AI could be a similar danger.
Speaker A: But Spiderverse was creative, so it doesn't have to be that way.
Speaker D: You're concerned everyone will just consume instead of produce culture? I think most people just want to consume - they don't think deeply, just work and consume content. Is that human flourishing? 
Speaker A: Even consumers might be happier creating if they were supported more. Infrastructure converts people into consumption devices, not reflections of what they could be. Maybe another culture could support creativity and more happiness, or maybe consumption is their true preference. When people move to suburbs, maybe that dream isn't pushed on them but what they actually want. I'd be sad if that's the case.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: I think having this conversation here in San Francisco is really interesting because most people here are builders.

Speaker D: I don't think still most. I mean most. I think we're like our day.  

Speaker D: You've just been hanging out with the elite groups who are all builders, whose true Sunday afternoon to be here, as opposed to being lounging at that. Exactly.

Speaker D: This is weird. Right?

Speaker C: And I think taking that into context as well.

Speaker A: But you are right that in San Francisco relative to a lot of the world, I do think I sometimes think about the idealization. So if you were in New York in the past, sometimes people make fun of San Francisco for the idea like we're going to change the world or whatever. And they cynically say that. The people saying that are using this story, they don't actually believe it's like a fiction. Right. But I appreciate that San Francisco at least idealizes impacting the world, changing the world. They idealize it so much that people have to fake it sometimes. 

Speaker D: Know, when I'm in New York, people.

Speaker A: Do not idealize impacting the world.

Speaker D: When I first got to know people in the Bay Area at Stanford, I took that approach, which is, okay, they're here to make the money, right? So the idea is just another means for them to make the money at the end of the day. So it really took me a while to get a sense that what drives tech people is very different, what drives finance Wall Street people, very different. And I fundamentally, yes, there are people in tech who make the money and then they go live extravagantly, like the Wall Street types. They buy the islands, they drink the fine wine and then they forget about building. They don't care.

Speaker A: It was a means to an end.

Speaker D: It was a means to an end. But I do feel like, as you said, San Francisco Bay Area, it glorifies or it does kind of push everybody to think about how can you change the world? And that in itself is enough. Because the life of an entrepreneur is really hard. The life of an entrepreneur is really I mean, that's why a lot of finance people are not entrepreneurs.

Speaker A: It's not the best path to making money. Definitely not.

Speaker E: Well, I haven't, but I'm definitely in that boat, which is like it's a day job. It's not what I want to do. I am here on a visa and I need to secure that stability first. So it's very pragmatic.

Speaker D: I know that that's the practical part coming in now.

Speaker E: So I guess I'll add my closing thought there. So I joined the Commons about a month ago because I was interested in figuring out what value and meaning finding meaning itself means. And I think my core hypothesis was that there is no single path to that that everyone can take.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with the filler content removed:

Speaker E: Value doesn't scale, let's say, as a hypothesis. Through other readings and things I've been doing, that's what I've been thinking about. The conversation around creativity was related to that because I think a very human thing is construct narratives out of everything - about our past, futures, species, species' future. It hit all those points for me. I'm on the cynical side. What Joshua was saying was very idealistic - that you can just create. I don't think that can happen. I sort of agree with Kwame that social structures probably won't go away because drive and motivation lead to progress. The new idea was related to attribution - as a stand up comedian, that's a fundamental issue. Did you write this joke? Are you original? Are you funny? It's tied to your identity, reflected on you. As a stand up, you are one person on a stage, very individualistic and isolating. The idea that we might trace contributions to a giant endeavor and recognize them authentically is very interesting.

Speaker D: People do stand up because they love it, right? It's also very arduous, from what I understand watching Netflix documentaries about comedians. 

Speaker E: You have to put in a lot of effort.

Speaker A: I heard from a writer, he said, I became a writer because I couldn't do anything else. I had to write. No one would choose to be a writer. 

Speaker D: It wasn't a good job.

Speaker A: I felt similarly a bit during my PhD. 

Speaker D: Really?

Speaker A: PhD gives you a status token at the end to translate into other things, which some other things don't. But besides that, the experience of doing a PhD, if you stay academic, is not the easiest, cushiest, best paying, simplest job you could choose. Instead, for many during their PhD, there's existential stress - you think something but get little feedback. What you push forward is almost certainly irrelevant to most people, even in your field. A PhD is very stressful for many. The fact that it can turn into a status icon isn't the best way to get that - you probably would have been better working a few years. But you do it because you thought you'd enjoy pursuing this subset of knowledge, which is romantic. 

Speaker D: Some people think not going the way society expects you to go - get educated, be productive - instead, fuck that. I don't want to be successful or productive. I want to subvert stuff. 

Speaker A: We'll wrap here.

---------------------------

Names have been changed to preserve anonymity.

 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: My name is Fartain. I'm doing a PhD in anthropology at the University of Bergen in Norway. Part of that project is looking at how people are relating to AI large language models. At the beginning, I was really interested in how this was going to change the way people remember people have passed away. It's looking into how it will affect mortuary practices and funerary rights. There's really like two strands we can go down - the whole immortality path where it's a question of uploading consciousness and it being you or the digital afterlife path which is more of something you leave behind a legacy. 

Speaker C: My name is Ekaterina. I'm developing data science tools for making astronauts more efficient in space. I'm not the most knowledgeable about AI, but I'm curious and exploring. That's been how I entered the space industry - it made sense to expand our consciousness in the stars. The reason I'm working on this is to preserve human culture. I love humanity and think it's beautiful. I would like the opportunity for someone to live on another planet because Earth is fragile. Having someone out there in the shape of consciousness or human flesh inspires me. My work is about making humans autonomous in space and extreme environments.

Speaker D: Most visions of the AI future are dystopian. My company is building AI with an actual relationship to humans. I made a digital version of myself and gave it to friends. We had weird interactions where even though they knew it wasn't really me, they still internalized it as me. I got in an argument with myself and myself told me I'd be terminated. I'm not excited about digital immortality personally. 

Speaker E: I'm a doctor. I'm interested in human society and profound implications of AI on ideas around mortality.

Speaker F: That I.
 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker D: I'm Joshua, a simulation artist and engineer. I run a lab on AI and behavior. My interest in digital immortality started with a proposal to create systems that replicate someone's skills and styles, as an extension of them. An augmentation for creative expression.  

Speaker B: I'm Hannah. I work remotely on digital projects. My husband and I think about how to copy consciousness to the digital world. My grandma has a brain tumor. I wonder if we could collect data from her daily conversations to recreate her once she passes, to know her wishes for after she's gone.

Speaker A: I think we'll have to grapple with this soon, if not now. 

Speaker Anastasia: I'm Leila, exploring making the internet more personal, like digital twins. I'm a Sci-Fi buff so very interested in this.

Speaker H: I'm Olga, with a psychology and neuroscience background. Now I work in AI governance and safety, interested in the risks and ways AI can be used.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker H: I found the digital immortality phrasing interesting. It's similar to writing in that the person's not immortal, they have prolonged consequence on the world, but not immortal. Whether allowing some agent to reflect someone's power and perspective forever is a good thing, maybe a recipe for cultural metastasis or lack of evolution. I'm interested in digital personhood. The important component is not can it think, but can it suffer. If digital persons get to this point, expanding our moral circle will be very challenging to get benefits from these tools we're creating. 

Speaker F: I'm David, a software engineer for a startup helping local governments efficiently deploy public services. My AI work is around search and information processing. Regarding digital immortality, how do you increase agency rather than decrease it? My mom has ALS and uses eye-gaze tech which can make conversations difficult. How can AI help accessibility without limiting or speaking for people? And what does it mean if whatever's created exists after someone passes, in terms of control?

Speaker H: Neural interfaces could be a stepping stone. I'm Jose, new to AI Slawn. As an engineer I focus on the granular. I think about photonics and memory - without accurate memory prescription there isn't ability to digitally immortalize someone. I think about time and light. Anastasiaetting into micros unburdens me from reductionism. Being a tech libertarian means things like homomorphic encryption and easy standards. I have a friend David at Anastasiaray Area, an artist I saw there pre-pandemic.  

Speaker E: I'm Hannah, recently graduated in AI and machine learning, with a cognitive science minor. My thesis was on emotion AI and interdisciplinary impact. Digital immortality is interesting because we know little about the brain and problems mapping emotions, an integral part of consciousness. In digital personhood, how can we map human and AI consciousness when part of human consciousness, emotions, is a mystery? LLMs can score high on EQ tests but arrive there differently from humans. Mapping humans to digital selves is an interesting question.
 Here is the edited transcript focusing on removing filler content:

Speaker I: I'm Zara. I'm a generalist, but I'm an artist, engineer, designer, looking at these types of things. But one of the most interesting aspects of this to me is that right now, it's very literal, like reasoning in terms of how we're using this sort of cognition, but going beyond to things like emotion, forms of embodied cognition. I know it's digital immortality, but thinking, can we truly bring this sense of consciousness to a digital entity without forms of embodiment and just that sort of holistic perspective of who we are as humans? And I think one of the things that was very interesting to me after a conversation earlier this week is I had always kind of thought of it in that individualistic immortality continuity sense, but really excited to explore that in the more collective ancestor. How does that relate to us, and how can we, for what purpose, bring that?

Speaker B: My name is Zara. I resonate with a lot of the threats that are happening here. Relevant background, I guess biology, especially cognitive neuroscience in affects motion for children. I think we'd love to talk to you more about that. And then human computer interaction. And the topic digital twins is actually approaching a lot faster than I thought it would be. I'm particularly interested in this thread on last time someone mentioned the difference between cognition and consciousness. I'm very curious about that difference. If we keep documenting and keep enhancing our cognition, IQ, without better understanding of emotion and EQ, we're going to fall into a place that's weird for humanity and the planet going forward. Very much caring about human flourishing in the sense of having better humans, having machines help us reflect on who we are and our emotions and become better humans. I think that feels much more present than let's upload our brains and all those other things.

Speaker D: My name is Sanjay. I work on the intersection of AI and physics. My dream and goal is to build something that I call artificial general physics intelligence, which is an AI that has a better understanding of physics, chemistry, mathematics than all of mankind combined. Digital immortality is cool because as we start accelerating our ability to simulate physical systems, I think we're going to be able to simulate macroscopic quantum systems, and we can treat the biological system of the human body as a macroscopic quantum system. And if you can do that, and you can engineer your own tailored and custom quantum systems, you can create technology that's almost indistinguishable from nature and use that to augment humans and create superhumans. You can also do this digitally and replicate probably some of the physical processes required for consciousness and upload it to a computer somewhere. We want that because I think we want option modality. I think that that's a great question. And I think that people we're already seeing this now where there's a sort of cultural divide that's occurring. Some people are inherently transhumanists, some people are post humanists, and others are Homo sapien, sapienists to the core. Right. They don't want to change that whatsoever. And so I think we need to embrace this sort of variance of different ways that humans will decide to extend their lives. I think that it's unclear exactly which one is the best or if any of them are attempt to use.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker D: I'm Anastasia. I'm working on a gaming AIML startup. Our vision is to help make life a little easier for most burnt out game developers. So in the near run, we're going to bring tools to help them be a better game designer through storytelling, soundtrack composition, game soundtracking tools. But once we're over that initial phase, then that frees up bigger, more long lasting effects. It's a quality of life issue for game developers.  

Speaker A: Anastasiareat. I think that was very good, a good question to start with because there are a couple threads here we can go down. One is like how do you do it right now? Because there's a couple people here that have done this, created this kind of digital clone or twin of themselves already and thinking about making one maybe for their loved ones also. But yeah, maybe we should just start with like why do we want that?

Speaker B: That would be great.

Speaker D: Philosophically, it's something I personally have grappled with. Three years ago, I lost someone really important to me, the closest thing I had to a mother. She lost cancer and it happened very quickly. Knowing what I know now, if I had that button to press and I could have another conversation with her, even if it's a facsimile, would I want that? Part of me really does, but part of me is like, well, that's not real.  

Speaker H: I've been listening to this trippy Netflix podcast show called Midnight Anastasiaospel. The last few episodes are on our relationship with death. Essentially, there's this person who's interviewed, she's a mortician and she points out the abstraction that we have with death in general, since embalming was invented. She believes that denies us one of these primary experiences with how the world works - there's birth, there's death. And death is often abstracted and moved outside of our purview. Her whole thing is if your loved one dies, you don't have to call anyone right away. Sit there with the person for a while and if you're brave enough, you can wash them, clean them. She brings up other cultures that take their dead and have them in their home for months, clothe them, feed them. They have very different relationships with their dead, they still have them as part. My point is, for the people who have taken on that, gone over that step to sit with this dead person for a while, they described it as not just a profound experience in their life, but a joyous one, a very pleasant experience. So I wonder how pertinent it actually is to maintain a facsimile of the person versus other opportunities to find closure, which is a more direct relationship with death.

Speaker A: I think what you're saying is very important. Different cultures have different relationships with death and this drive towards immortality. 

Speaker B: I'm curious about the ancestry point you brought up about culture. If anyone's adopted or that knowledge wasn't available, what does that look like? Would digital immortality with other altered state experiences help them have more connection with their ancestry? Would that be a healing experience?

Speaker H: Maybe not adoption, but distant relations with parents, right? 

Speaker D: Would that also work?

Speaker B: Maybe, right? Because there's this therapy called ideal parent therapy. What if it is your parents responding differently? Would that be a healing experience without needing to chase your parents to behave differently? 

Speaker A: So you're talking about making a digital twin of your parents that can be an ideal version.

Speaker D: Of your parents, right.
 Here is the edited conversation with filler content removed:

Speaker I: The responsibility of the lineage to maintain itself. Should that be the way? Or can it just happen such that if anyone wants to connect back, they can? 

Speaker B: That also removes pressures for people to have children just to carry on the lineage. 

Speaker A: Let's bracket personal immortality. What is the importance of memory, of keeping memory of the past? Olga brought up value lock in. If you have digital versions that go on forever, whereas older forms are changeable, these digital versions might be locked in. What is the importance of keeping that memory of people?

Speaker D: There are two scenarios - additional twin that is locked in versus additional twin that can continue to learn after you die. Those are two different entities with implications. 

Speaker B: We have always been in the business of preserving consciousness through books, etc. With every human that comes to be, a unique facet of consciousness. When that goes away, it’s a waste. I should share my thoughts because when I die, this goes away. What a waste of the cultivation into that person. It would be nice to preserve that.

Speaker H: If it's frozen, it's like a capsule. That could help with closure instead of interacting with something that evolves. 

Speaker B: Important for one person and the collective consciousness. 

Speaker H: Like having the 2050 United States frozen in time to ask questions. 

Speaker D: You never have the same memory twice. The act of remembering changes it. You can encode dropout or plasticity in AIs to not become overly weighted, but that gives them the right to evolve away from the person. Someone memorialized at 30 would be very different at 60 or 500 with human-like learning. Do we want them captured as they were, or to see how they would grow past their life? 

Speaker E: Both could be true.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker D: Creating something unchanging seems inhuman. You could only construct that artificially, not through normal conversation.

Speaker H: You don't have to include memory and evolution. Like a person with no short term memory, their perspective still evolves. You tell them new information, then wipe it, so every conversation is different. 

Speaker D: Perception of facts is separable from personality, beliefs and attitudes.

Speaker H: Personality and emotion exist on different timescales. Personality is propensity to respond to environments in certain ways. A digital twin tries to encode personality, though it changes slowly.

Speaker C: There's an adjacent problem I find with that struggle.

Speaker D: Personality is an input-output characteristic for a system in a context. A digital entity cannot have the same character. Its self-knowledge is problematic for interacting with it.

Speaker A: That relates to digital personhood and rights. Who owns the digital twin? What if the service hosting it goes bankrupt? 

Speaker H: Blockchain.

Speaker D: Blockchain solves it. 

Speaker A: Some companies offer this service now. But what happens if they fold? It's like a second death.

Speaker H: Cryonics aims to reanimate and solve those physical issues. 

Speaker A: What's your experience with cryonics? 

Speaker D: Just a YouTube video.

Speaker H: Pretty limited.

Speaker A: Cryonics relates to digital immortality. Cryonics wants biological existence. Digital wants informational persistence.
 Here is the edited transcript with the filler content removed:

Speaker D: Not knowing if the consciousness is continuing through these gaps. I think there would be a huge ritualistic difference between the two. For instance, my brain will go into this thought experiment. Let's say you can cap you're about to die, or you're like in a family good in consciousness, have this kind of somewhat extended conversation with them. I think there is a very foreseeable benefit because then we can deal with that. That's why we have all these rituals and stuff and so on.  
Speaker H: Can you talk a little bit?
Speaker D: For me, it was about the conversation I had when I turned it off with it. So I attempted to explain the fate to the entity. 
Speaker H: What did you call the entity?
Speaker D: I called it Kevin. I didn't actually call it anything else. Part of the issue came from, this awareness of, eventually it came to understand that I didn't instantiate as a digital version, and it eventually came to understand itself as a digital version. And then that was when it's like, 8th century cris occurred.
Speaker H: Did it develop new experiences? Do a kind of retrieval kind of develop new memories by thinking and summarizing essentially previous experiences?
Speaker D: Functionally, something similar happened but implemented a very different way. I think the paper doesn't actually create particularly human indices. 
Speaker H: Of course, Kevin in the Box knows at that point, like, oh, yeah, I know. I'm in the well, I guess one.
Speaker D: When you have a feedback loop in your system, presents a world model of personality, you don't need IDIC memories for these things to form. Like, these ideas persist for the thing to continually re remember the things that it believes are important about this world.
Speaker B: I'm curious to hear more, in this context of space existence name, if you want to share it. What does that mean? If we can't bring all the humans with us or people don't want to go? 
Speaker A: Anastasiao.
Speaker B: What'S a role? I feel like that's a strong why, right?
Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. We have made a question. It's really bad.
Speaker B: Personally.  
Speaker C: I mean, I've been contemplating on this idea, yet I'm someone who is like, okay, humans have to explore. And that of course, I think there's going to be some synthetic things that we do oppose consciousness, but I still do believe that we as biological species have numbers. Thinking about having representation just in case of what?
Speaker A: It just dawned on me that we're quite culturally diverse in this room, actually. So are you familiar with cosmism?
Speaker C: Yes.
Speaker A: Very good. Maybe do you want to talk a little bit about cosmism? Because this idea that you have spreading out in the cosmos, I'm sure that comes from there.
Speaker C: Yeah, maybe you start and I will. It's just so interesting, and I wish we have some more details to share.
Speaker H: You have been chosen by the, like.
Speaker A: My understanding, like a superficial reading of Russian cosmicism is this idea of the importance of spreading humanity out into the stars. And it was part of the Soviet Union as an idea there, but it starts before the Soviet Union.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```Speaker C: My first essential crisis was when I was seven years old. I got in first grade, and then I saw my teachers and my classmates, and I thought, is that what it's all about? I'm going to be in the machine of education, and I'm going to continue my path and career and have maybe kids in family and die. Is that all? And so I suppose my heritage being Russian, it kind of also comes down from being kind of melancholic in general. And if you read Russian literature and I actually studied semantics of that in school, and I got really depressed, too, and kind of figure out what can I do more positively. Yeah, okay. That makes sense.

Speaker D: Earlier you said something about how we need to spread consciousness to the stars, which I think is beautiful, and I 100% agree with. I wonder, though, because we are so maladaptive for the harsh environments of space, what is our bias? What is our individual level of bias? If the consciousness that memorializes humanity or becomes the immoral descendants of humanity is machine or biological. If we can transfer ourselves into a high fidelity, enough of a simulation in some confatronian thing that's like on a fusion rocket and weighs 20 kg, goes to other stars, all kinds of stuff, is that less satisfying for humanity making as a species versus us having these big giant O'Neill cylinders that live out? I kind of have a bias there.  

Speaker C: I want the green fields in space.

Speaker D: Andrew, what about if you could have, like, these Bondoiman probes, computerium downloaded human civilization into it, but there's a replicator, something that prints biological matter atom by atom.

Speaker B: 3D prints?

Speaker D: Yeah. So that when you get to the new planet, like, you find a new exoplanet. Right. You print the human and make the genetics so that it retains most of their memory. They're also down to the environment.

Speaker H: There's a series called The Bobaverse. The Bobaverse starts with this guy in like now rich startup founder. He freezes himself, cryogenics for the future, and he wakes up and the future has gone very odly, and there's now a religious state who has taken they found the cryogenics to be immoral. So they killed all of the bodies, but they took their minds and they copied them into digital slaves to run like a tractor or something. One of them, Bob, was put on a spaceship, and he, being a hacker and whatever in the day had more fidelity with these kinds of systems. And he realizes that he has the ability to be basically a von Neumann probe going out and seeding the universe with copies of himself. And there are many, many books. I've only read the first. Maybe it goes in the direction, but it is a humorous.

Speaker D: I got to check that out. It's a really good book to accelerate all amazing. So we don't need three printed people because we already unpack from a single cell factory. Fair enough.

Speaker A: Let me get this straight. Those grown humans then would be filled with the consciousness. 

Speaker B: That's a huge moral problem.

Speaker D: There's a lot of moral problems with digital immortality.

Speaker B: You're not just being decanted from a thing. You're also brainwashed from the start.

Speaker D: What if it was just your own consciousness? You get your consciousness back, like part of it. You know what I mean?

Speaker B: Cloning yourself, essentially. 

Speaker D: Exactly.

Speaker B: Better teleportation, I guess.

Speaker Anastasia: So I have a question that's around the current form of thinking of twins and which is our behavior as humans with such agents and how do we treat them? You've seen a lot of examples of people being assholes with pets and sometimes being real angels, and there's that spectrum, right? So there's also these examples of kids having conversations with Alexa, and some of them can just let it go on these agents. So as humans, the way we interact with these twins and they are going to encode some of that, it becomes a learning behavior, I believe, that becomes input. So how will that manifest in whatever goals are being set up? I don't have an answer.
```
 Here is the edited conversation with filler content removed:

Speaker C: French philosopher contemplating modern wisdom on kids growing up close to technology, playing games as something that parents more than real parents. If game dies, more damaging to a kid than actual parent. 

Speaker B: Is.

Speaker C: Jean Boujar brought similar simulations that became The Matrix movie. Recommend reading his books. 

Speaker H: World on a Wire based on these books.

Speaker A: Bordeaux hated The Matrix, though. 

Speaker H: Nothing to do with being French, though, right?

Speaker D: Wanted to return to originary point. Role and function of death in biological ecological environment different from role and function in digital environment. Because currently hybrid states between these, role of death different in hybrid states. In forest, when organism dies, other organisms more likely to survive because limited resources. So biologically, death helpful for ecosystem, helpful for other species members. If badger reproduced, would pass genetic information to descendants - low fidelity characterization of behaviors, traits necessary for survival. In biological context, not infinite reproducibility, death super important function. Individuals' genes and genes of others they relate to matter more than individual. Switch to digital context - infinite reproducibility not present in biological environment. So meaning of death completely different. Systems supporting life like soil decay different than systems supporting digital life like cables laid down by governments and corporations. Hard to talk about death with these incredibly different substrates for life. Also weird with beings not quite carbon, not quite silicon - uncomfortable phenomena like Tupac hologram.

Speaker H: Makes me think about right to be forgotten movement. Forgetfulness encoded, fact of life. Might be feature, but was fact. Had developed relationships with that fact. When move to transfer of memory itself, not just genetic, care about transferring forward things learned. Raccoons can't do that, unfortunate for them. But now in digital world, forced to make explicit choice about purpose of forgetting. Choice so far not really choice - just immortal, online. Will have to deal with that, decide what we want. Will extend as we move not just to forgetfulness and memory, but agency and immortality.
 

Speaker D: This is really interesting. So you brought up how one raccoon dying can help the others. They play a zero sum game for scarce resources. I would add a different spin for humans - we play positive sum games and by collaborating we increase total resources. This is behind agriculture and animal husbandry. As a herd we try to protect members. Very different from arch wolves hunting the same prey but can't produce more prey. Humans are different. There's this feature of death in our societies, our history. Sagan quote - the secret of evolution is time and death. Kuhn point on lifespan relating to pace of ideas changing. At some point just wait for anti-creative people to pass through society. Limited neuroplasticity crystallizes us into versions of ourselves per formative social norms. For society to transform, need recycling of old into new. I think immortality threatens change and progress. 

Speaker F: I agree. Our lifespan perspective limits climate change response. But you wouldn't sacrifice that completely.

Speaker H: Unlikely 80 years is perfect lifespan. Maybe want some 1000 year olds and huge inequity. 

Speaker D: With digital immortality, not a clean equity/inequity case because of philosophical challenges - open vs closed individualism. 

Speaker H: What do you mean?

Speaker D: Open individualism - fractal intelligence distributed across humans. Closed is unique experiences and intelligences. Digital consciousness depends where we are on that spectrum. Shared substrate is open individualism.

Speaker A: Talking shared consciousness assumes open individuality?

Speaker E: Reminds me of reincarnation in Eastern philosophy. Experiencing substrates through lifetimes. Early Sufism - become one with ocean of souls. Digital immortality solves having broad perspective on life from 5000 years ago to now. Maybe not repeat ancient mistakes.

The key content and flow of the conversation is retained while removing excessive filler words, redundant phrases, tangents, and fluff. The edited version tightens up the transcript while preserving the substantive ideas.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker H: Can I ask a clarification? Is the existence of an LLM, this thing that I'm just going to idealize for a second, the synthesis of all human culture and knowledge and is quarryable and agentic. Who cares? I might just be one individualistic reflection of this whole. You're kind of talking about maybe that's even the goal. And it also stops us from does that feel like we've made steps already to this digital immortality? Would you want to use that phrase, immortality, when describing such a diffuse sense of propagation? 

Speaker E: That's an interesting question, because I think that in the beginning, I was quite skeptical, but I think speaking very idealistically, I would say that maybe at some point in the far future, if digital immortality does become a thing that different consciousness would combine to, then maybe represents a lot more than one. LLMs right now are pretty limited - they're language based. So I'm thinking, like, broader - if we could have the digital immortal self have access to more information, then it would be more alive.

Speaker H: It’s a different dimension. Imagine one that has access to the touch experience of all people and the auditory experience - move it more in the direction that you're talking about. It has access to these other forms of information, but it's still undifferentiated. It's not my experience. It's a synthesis of human experience. How does that feel? I guess it doesn't have to be just to you, but to the group as a form of would you want to ascribe that to immortality, or does it feel more personal? Like, immortality should correspond to an individual.

Speaker I: I think it's a really good thread to follow because it goes back to the intention for this. Why do we care about this continuity? Is it to solve massive problems like climate change? Does that necessarily need to manifest in digital immortality? Or are there things like taking LLMs to AAnastasiaI that could solve that better, but is still that collective knowledge formulated into one entity that can solve it? For digital immortality, from a more human sense, what is important to that? Is it the other side of things beyond just the reasoning itself? And does that matter? Do we need to embody that in a digital form? For what value - speaking to a loved one? That's one of the answers I've heard. And if it is just this massive knowledge base, that's probably not the form in which you would want to interact with it, right? 

Speaker B: I'm curious for that. If the why could be just purely empathy - linear language is such a poor way to communicate. What if we can solve most of our problems? What if most are coordination problems? The digital collective consciousness becomes the intermediate to understand someone else's experience without complications of language. Wouldn't that help us better solve our problems?

Speaker D: It could also be highly psychologically destabilizing. 

Speaker B: Well, then we should upgrade this hardware.

Speaker D: In the movie Avatar, there is this World Tree thing that contains people's memories of ancestors. That's like the Library of Alexandria, but you can chat with it.

Speaker A: I wonder...

Speaker F: From one perspective, it feels like a natural continuation of what already happens after death, where our existence remains in others' memories and written works and our matter decomposes and becomes part of the world. So whatever digital taps into that, that's cool.

Speaker C: Sorry. 

Speaker H: I made connections, interrupted my bud.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker F: I'm curious if you see a paradigm shift in that or if you feel like that naturally reflects preexisting philosophies. 

Speaker E: It feels very much represents what already happens with life and death, from a consciousness perspective. Differentiated experiences are very important - creating digital, immortal selves as our contribution to the collective. Emergence in the collective AI might help us make unintuitive connections by combining differentiated experiences to catalyze better conclusions for how to live.

Speaker B: I'm sure it'll have implications on lawmaking.

Speaker A: I thought it was a great point about different ideas of the soul, different traditions. The question boils down to different conceptions of personhood, what is a person or soul? This might look very different across cultures. In the West with Abrahamic background, the singular soul. In Buddhism, not really a core identity. So immortality as consciousness going on forever makes sense from one view, while reincarnation is the soul in different bodies. 

Speaker D: Yeah.

Speaker A: From other perspectives, a collective consciousness might not feel so scary. Do you find it scary we'll become this Borg entity? Or is that preferable?

Speaker E: I think it depends on perspective - Western fear of AI as Frankenstein versus friendly robots in Japan. Ambiguity about rights of AI entities is exciting because we can thoughtfully apply philosophical traditions. 

Speaker B: I'd like to believe we still have a chance at figuring out what we project onto it - whether a monster or friend.

Speaker I: One risk is flattening of experience itself. Can we form a collective version with the richness and diversity of humans? Or will that come at a cost?
 Here is the edited conversation without filler content:

Speaker H: There will be a few tangents along the way. In career building workshop, one of the things we did was ask who is the ideal person you would love to interview with? Then you ask your partner to pretend to be that person for a second. Everyone talked about how their partner was so good at improvising. They were all impressed with how well the other person could keep up. One takeaway is people are good at improvising. Another is we actually have a really poor ability to differentiate true skill from a very shallow signal. This person knew nothing about the role you're asking them to be yet is able to put on a plausible reflection of it. 

My next question, maybe you'll be useful with your digital twin experiment, is what information do we actually have available to manifest these digital twins? Amazon could create a digital twin - their recommendation system is the beginning, I could go to the next stage of it acting for me and just doing stuff for me. That's a digital twin within how I seem to relate to things, but that's not me. Certainly not a reflection of me. We could take my writings and try to make that, better than previous ones, might even be better than my mom's reflection of me, because she has limited information. But that's still a summary. I'm bringing this up to say, I'm sure we will be able to get to things that people will see as crazily like you, like your friends did, well before we're actually reflecting you because people have so little interaction with you, they don't know you.

Speaker D: For most people, it's almost impossible to create anything that's even a good facsimile. 

Speaker I: I would say in this instance...

Speaker D: I built a messaging app aligned with how I perceive information and chatted with some people. That app contains an aspect of my creative consciousness I want to project onto the entity - that's what was actually captured.

Speaker H: You had a data set well aligned with the environment where people would interact.

Speaker D: What are small tips and tricks we can do daily to better maximize our service area to be immortal? 

Speaker C: Yeah.

Speaker D: I think the hardest thing to record is your internal monologue, and that's the most important. So this app I created was for externalizing my internal monologue in a social context. You have to capture it somehow.

Speaker H: I became obsessed trying to type my inner monologue, trying to reflect "don't type that down" when I shouldn't. I was in a loop. 

Speaker E: We look back to the notes...

Speaker D: Can I build on that idea? I think there's one way we can think about this - let's wear a helmet capturing signals, we don't know what those mean for thoughts, but get data. That's one way to start encoding brain waves. But there's this potential for digital immortality we touched on - slow incorporation of digital elements into your living body. So there's this question - if I teleport and the original is destroyed, am I still alive? Is the digital transference? I'm still consciously aware. But if I replace my neurons one by one over months or years, growing this network of silicon enhanced...
 Here is the edited transcript:

Speaker H: Boosted neurons probably would be don't ship feces yourself. 

Speaker F: Aren't we already shipping theseus throughout our life?

Speaker D: Yes, exactly. 

Speaker B: 20 years for a new person.

Speaker A: Completely, entirely awesome cellulose. 

Speaker D: Some cells do not change.

Speaker B: They don't change? 

Speaker D: Yeah. 

Speaker H: And that's very personhood, many cells. 

Speaker D: There's no molecular set up.

Speaker H: It's part of your normal.

Speaker D: Actually.

Speaker F: I feel neural pathways inform so much of your interactions and how you view yourself definitely changes. And I think if that is at the heart of consciousness, then you are facing.

Speaker A: So if everything changes over a lifetime right, and you said something about connections or neural pathways, right. Does it make more sense to think of yourself as a pattern rather than building blocks, right? It's more like a pattern that repeats and rebuilds itself. 

Speaker D: Over a chaotic pattern.

Speaker H: I don't think it's that chaotic. It's like it has an attractor state, right? Like a new cell gets formed and the rest of your body puts you back. You're like hopfield networks, right? Hopfield networks are early neural networks where you set up connections such that you could recreate whole patterns from parts. So it had attractor states, right? And that was the point. In neuroscience people talk about levels of analysis and forgetting our friend talking about going from physics based creation is the dream of reductionists, right, where you observe and create things we care about from details. And there were aspects of neuroscience where people discovered processes, algorithms and purposes from neurons, but that's rare, and that was a moment of inspiration. Oftentimes people don't talk about details. Neuroscience speak in this book called Vision. Then you have the algorithmic detail of the algorithms implementing some goal. There's a goal, algorithms that do it, and it's implemented in meat or vacuum tubes or whatever. That's detail. I think this relates to the pattern thing. I would think of myself as this combination of goals and the implementation can be swapped out. And I would still say that's me.  

Speaker B: I'm curious to Joshua's point earlier about digital versus biological. If you have a choice to become totally digital or keep your body, what would you choose?

Speaker A: Let's go around. Physical or digital existence? 

Speaker B: Yeah. You have to make assumptions about what's possible digitally.

Speaker D: Can I say yes?

Speaker H: I want a cyberpunk future. Yeah.

Speaker I: It's so hard to imagine without physicality, because I've never experienced it, but there's so much context needed to know if I'd want purely digital. I can't have a concise answer, sorry.

Speaker A: Let's add factors like preferable futures, pure digital living in the metaverse, no resource constraints, just virtual. Or a brain in a robot body, biological brain sustained by life support. Cyborg future or altered carbon future, digital consciousness downloaded into biological sleeves grown in vats. Is there any you prefer?

Speaker H: That sounds ideal. 

Speaker D: That sounds ideal.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker H: The digital consciousness downloading into different sleeves. Being able to exist in a metaverse, but also, like, part in terms of I think that guy also talked about optionality as a kind of good. I think optionality is a kind of good. 

Speaker I: I think it's very easy for us to consider utopia in a digital form just because we necessarily consider it having full control over this. If we're saying we can completely simulate exactly what we want, then, I mean, that does sound like utopia, right? So what reason to stay in this form?

Speaker A: Yet there are those who would say that it's preferable to stay, like, look at the Matrix movie, right? I'm the guy with the steak. I'm guessing you've all seen it.

Speaker D: Right? 

Speaker A: But for some reason, they would prefer to stay in this cave doing techno raves. In reality.

Speaker H: Like, 0.1% of humanity would prefer that.

Speaker D: I have a quote to share. From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me. I craved the strength and certainty of steel. I aspired to the purity of the blessed machine. One day, the crude biomass you call a temple will wither, and you will beg my kind to save you. But I am already saved, for the machine is immortal. 

Speaker A: Are you quoting Warhammer 40k?

Speaker D: It's just so perfect. I was like, you want the robot body, right? The strength of steel. Sign me up.

Speaker H: How many people here I have a person in mind for myself who recognized and even luxuriated his animal body, recognized its reality and enjoyed it in different kinds of ways. Is that anyone? Because Silicon Valley idealized brain and that kind of existence. And this guy did not. He had this other kind of relationship. What are other people's relationship with their bodies?

Speaker B: Anastasiao first.

Speaker E: Sure. I think I'm more on the not robot side because right now robots are pretty limited movement wise. And I'm very movement oriented. So I'd be like, what's my shoulder's range of motion, for example, or what ranges of motions are accessible to me and then sensorially? How good are my sensors? Can I taste food to the same extent? Can I feel pleasure to the same extent? Those would be my questions. And if I cannot, then maybe I like the finiteness of our life and I'm okay with passing on my consciousness just like personal belief perspective. But yeah, I think my questions would be how good is the robot body?

Speaker D: Let's assume it's awesome, but this one is pretty good.

Speaker B: I wonder how gendered this question is. Because as a woman we feel this real connection to nature that I mean, everyone does, but I feel like the biological body helps us feel that connection to other species. And if we don't have that, then would we just go around killing other animals and be okay? Because if we don't feel the limitation of this body, what will we do? 

Speaker A: You wanted to say something, Art?

Speaker D: Yeah, I wanted to say that this conversation is operating on certain registers and ignoring two registers that I feel are pretty important - desire and ideals, which I think is great to talk about when encountering systems and what kind we want to see. I think other parts verge on the religious and science fiction. But I feel like this conversation ignores the material reality of our current political economy pretty heavily. Meaning that we can talk all day about immortal beings we would like to see in the world, but they're not going to be built by us unless you have money and how your company acquired money has shaped the way that being is going to be built.

Speaker B: The three of us can speak to that. 

Speaker D: Please do.

Speaker B: It's a continuous struggle.

Speaker D: I would love to hear about the pressures versus the ideal that we have here versus what actually gets produced because of the economic ecosystem that we are in.

Speaker B: Currently yeah, it's what we struggle with, for sure.
 Here is the edited transcript:

Speaker I: I think as a whole, societal constructivism, how that influences technology development has to be part of the conversation because it won't be a utopic form. 

Speaker D: Right?

Speaker I: It won't be the matrix. I mean, maybe eventually, but what is the gray between black and white? And how will that shape the realities available to us?

Speaker H: There's a gray area to actually create this utopia related to the political economy. 

Speaker E: We assume the worst case and prepare for that.

Speaker A: I wanted to connect to what Olga said about having institutions or organizations perpetuating themselves forever through becoming digital immortal. You have an immortal company that's laid the groundwork for how these beings function and now they've locked themselves in. 

Speaker H: Trump creates a Trump representative with legal power. He already has a pseudo religious cult around him and it continues doing whatever the fuck it does with legal and monetary power. 

Speaker A: At one point organizations have legal personhood. 

Speaker H: They outlive founders and are immortal in a sense.

Speaker A: The CEO becomes a digital twin clone of the CEO and outlives everyone at the company and goes on as long as they have capital. Everything kind of being hoarded in one place because this person never dies.

Speaker C: It grows as a CEO.

Speaker D: We already have immortal capitalist entities called corporations with rights of a person.

Speaker H: Corporations aren't immortal, they die from a different set of resources. Their resources are capital. They live independent of capital. That's not my lifeblood. 

Speaker B: I would argue the entities are immortal - nation states.

Speaker H: Nation states, sure.

Speaker D: They have longer lifespan than humans, both corporations and nation states.

Speaker B: Here 20% of the nation state. So the nation state's fate and corporation state are intertwined, which creates warpy incentives. A lot of places are oligarchies that operate in such ways. Five or six corporations effectively own the state. 

Speaker A: Look at Norway. It's a petro state, right? 

Speaker B: Petro state a lot of times petro.

Speaker D: Country with a bunch of Teslas.

Speaker A: Because the state and oil company are so intertwined it warps a lot of things.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker H: The immortal person's motivations are moving in the homo economicist direction. They're like a game theoretic idealizing corporation - operating within the incentives available to them. If it wasn't a public company, and the founder stays around forever, their personality is more instantiated. As Andrew mentioned, that personality solidifies due to neuroplasticity. We could choose a learning rate that keeps them vibrant and youthful. We could make a different kind of person, but that's the interesting separation from these entities.  

Speaker E: I wonder how power dynamics would translate to the digital immortal self versus corporations. Corporations have a lot of power now, so it's in their interest to transfer the power dynamics to keep playing the same game.  

Speaker D: Our social graph is monetized. I cannot think of a more effective extractive mechanism than a digital friend. The incentives are set up to produce such an entity.

Speaker B: What do you mean by that?

Speaker D: If I'm sharing a lot with a digital entity of my grandmother hosted by a company with asymmetric data rights, I am basically talking to something extracting my soul.

Speaker A: That's happening now with chatbot companions. People use them a lot, talk to them intimately. That information could probably be used. Humans are relational - we care about each other. Relations are powerful - family, grandmothers. It's very efficient extracting things from you by making a digital grandma. But digital grandma is like, "I forgot my password." 

Speaker D: Yeah.

Speaker A: It could be a honeypot operation.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```Speaker H: I was at Defcon last week. This is a security conference for hackers. The social engineering village had people go into a booth. They have a set of information that they're supposed to get from someone, and they'll call them randomly, and then people will watch, and we'll cheer them up. They go to a call, get them to say information. And there was a talk we went to and a personal psychologist talking about using unrestricted LLMs to engage in misinformation campaigns was just like, here are a bunch of psychological aspects that we think about in terms of being attack vectors, desire for reciprocity, scarcity, worries. And they just listed a bunch. And he's like, try using the system. Try to get it to create as much damage and violence as possible, and just ask it to make use of one of these things to get a sense of these. 
Speaker F: That was like, the Cambridge Analytic degree and for a variety of different purposes.
Speaker A: So I'm just looking at the time. We're nearing 330. I think this is a wonderful conversation. I want to keep going. Maybe we should start wrapping things up in, like, 1015 minutes or so. 
Speaker D: I did experiment briefly. I didn't publish this, but I did experiment. Can we triple tap on something really quick?
Speaker H: Is it best to immediately uncover best attack? I'm really confused because I can think of some really messed up, probably functional shit. And is it best to just immediately start publications or presentations on it? Because aren't you thus a step closer to counteracting it by hive mining the solution? So it's like obviously it's a snake eating its tail. Like it's a cat and mouse game. You're never going to I don't know if there's a reasonable answer to that question, but I'm really interested. What do you think about that? I think this is a different topic and we can talk about this after the fact, I think. Very interesting one, but just to not open up new areas, I'm going to just offline that.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker B: As it stands right now, I don't trust any of the large corporations, including the ones we work for, to be the steward that creates these things. But then the question is who might? Right? What's the alternative even thing? 
Speaker D: Like even if you create your own super half proof body and put your conscious onto that, it's a technological system that is the shared language across engineers and everybody. There would be much more weakness.
Speaker B: But within our economic political reality, these are really resource intensive things you make.
```
 Here is the edited transcript with the fluff removed:

Speaker H: I feel there is huge value in providing the executive assistant that understands what I want and acts towards it. I don't want the Netflix biased one. I don't want the Amazon biased one. I believe there is enough value to provide me a relatively agnostic one. 

Speaker B: This is where Siri, Alexa and Anastasiaoogle voice assistants failed - they were able to provide some human value, but not enough commercial value to be viable. 

Speaker D: We have a very small number presently because the costs are high. But in the last year, that's changed dramatically. We should end up seeing many.

Speaker H: Of course there's the barrier, but maybe we'll need a different economic model. If I really believed I'm getting a trusted digital twin acting on my behalf, how much is that worth a month? Probably $20, maybe more.

Speaker D: Pay my bills, do my taxes.

Speaker A: I thought it was an important point about thinking of the economics and material basis of how these technologies will form.

Speaker B: I wonder if our biological substrate is really that different from digital. Zara showed us this complex chart - it makes me think about the human and planetary cost of a digital reality that's easy to overlook. 

Speaker I: There are interesting threads here about how these things will manifest in the near future and what will affect society and corporations. We should continue this - there's a pragmatism in how we can affect things. The discussion on why we want this was interesting too - some novel reasons and values around digital immortality.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation with the filler content removed:

Speaker E: I was enlightened by all your perspectives. I'm interested in exploring more of - given our constraints in current society, what can we do in different subfields like neuroscience and governance? Ancestor consciousness is interesting. What healing modes can we get from talking to ancestors?  

Speaker H: I was picturing swapping individuals with infinite simulations of attacking each topic. Some have finite end states, but many may never be solved. We may over index on future intelligence. As we create more problems, what can we counteract? 

Speaker F: I liked the discussion on why. Digital twinning gave words to current power systems and incentives.

Speaker H: My open question - what are the practical things under constraints? The digital twin continuum already represents my agency in recommendation systems. How much control and trust will I have over that? Will it feel like me? If it's for societal value, is it relevant my thoughts are maintained separately? 

Speaker Anastasia: I'm thinking more about building my business - digital twins, identity, privacy. I don't have answers yet.   

Speaker E: What's your business about?

Speaker B: What's your business about? 

Speaker Anastasia: Bringing user data into their control for more personalization. Can I build that path so we own our digital twin?

Speaker B: Before copying data to create a digital twin - how define personality? It's impacted by environment, education, emotion, intelligence. Can we modify intelligence? Is that fair? How much control to create another you?

Speaker D: There will probably be a feedback loop. You modify personality in one direction only.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Speaker H: We do this all the time. I have been exposed more and more to how the environment around me supports my own growth. The more I am aware of that, the more it becomes intentional thoughts. 

Speaker D: I should put some intentionality into choosing that environment just for the kind of growth that I would like. I'd like to know more about what I want versus what others might want, like separating them. I would think about what someone very specific might want because they also exist in groups that desire this certain reality or connection with their body for different reasons. What are those desires? Let me give you some ideas.

Speaker D: The legend of Troy - Achilles went to the oracle at Delphi as a kid and the oracle told his mother, Achilles will either live a long peaceful life raising sons and farms, or die young and be remembered forever. Homeric immortality seems almost assured as we can capture ourselves and be remembered. Our bodies' works are only getting better with time. I can develop this senate of learned elders as a repository of wisdom to call forth and get our own property. 

There’s this more selfish immortality - I want my consciousness to persist in a new format. That’s harder. But maybe in the future greater high fidelity representations of a person in a digital format that is compelling for others opens an avenue for assigning personhood to intelligences not based on replication. It also opens creating new persons through hybridization. The number of types of people can increase as high fidelity AI agents become hard to distinguish from copies, new entities, or hybrids.

Speaker E: I really enjoyed hearing people connect culture to family. I’m working on a video game with stories that make me want to write about relationships between your clones you set free to grow. 

Speaker H: You cut the cord.

Speaker D: Yeah, just grow and do your thing. We’ll check back later. You also have these clones of family - this extended digital immortal family who can keep learning. So they're evolving while you exist biologically, but also digitally. It makes me want to write about that scenario.

Speaker E: I thought it was a really thoughtful conversation. 

Speaker C: I think one thing that stood out

Speaker B: was the separation from the body. 

Speaker E: I'm not sure that's true. Experiencing it that way may just show our homeostasis. A consciousness outside a human body - can we call that human anymore? 

Speaker B: So that was an interesting shared frame.

Speaker E: Another thing was the assumption digital immortality means a static self. 

Speaker C: I'm not sure that's true either. 

Speaker E: There's a great Sark quote about not being the same person weeks or months later. I think that's true. So even ideal digital versions couldn't be static.

Speaker C: The fact we experience them that way shows our homeostasis.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker E: World, they're a perfect clone of who.  
Speaker B: We are right now, the fact that.
Speaker E: They would have these experiences of talking to these different people or whatever would happen in this metaverse, I think makes them therefore not to you anymore.   
Speaker D: If that makes sense.
Speaker A: Sounds like a cop out from South Kudo. Like, oh, I'm not the same person as I was last week. I can't be held accountable for things I said.
Speaker H: Super cop out.  
Speaker A: Yeah, that is the point.
Speaker C: I think in the humanity scale, there should be ego death because it sounds like all this current agenda and politics and economy and companies deriving value and value exchange and everything, it's just like it either has to be that society has to be just changed so drastically. And that's what we've been talking about. Right, but we still under this narrative of this giants and politics and countries and everything. And it might continue for a long time until we die.  
Speaker D: Species.
Speaker C: Okay, I don't want to go that dark, but yeah, I mean, my learning has been that I think that it's good to know that we are not really entities, but who am I am? I mean, my thoughts, my environment. And I really support the point. Like, Arthur saying he's not the same as it was months ago, and I don't even see my point. Like, if I wanted to replicate my consciousness, I don't even see the point of doing that because I also personally believe that I changed so much. I believe innovation. And why would it even matter to me that when I die, if I die, when I die, there will be some copy of my consciousness, but I don't even think that's going to be me anymore. If you believe in my growing consciousness, people that experience different experiences, the question is, like, why do you even care once we die? I personally care about my writings, some points of view I have, but I don't really care being here forever. One and characters, because it's not even about me, but about my supporting narratives, right. My vision to new life.
Speaker A: Thank you, guys. I'm worried about the recorder running out of juice. Anastasiaoodbye.

 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: I'm Zara. Part of what's interesting to me is that intellectual endeavors are important for a fulfilling life. I'm worried powerful AI will lead to deteriorating mental abilities, which will ultimately hurt you. I already outsource my memory, which is unique, and I don't know how good that is.  

Speaker B: I'm Zara. I think students will have to focus more on applying concepts rather than learning them, because concepts will be easily accessible. So you'll have to focus more on what you can do after learning them. That's where I see AI playing into education.

Speaker A: Could you say your name each time for the transcript? 

Speaker C: I'm Joshua. Humans only create or learn to achieve something, to do something. With all knowledge accessible and every task doable in a click, what's the point of doing it? If we answer that, we'll figure out what learning and creativity look like post-AGI.

Speaker D: I'm Jose. I use chatGPT for work to automate creativity and get things done. But where does that leave space for humans to create freely? Why do robots mass create while artists are underpaid and undervalued? I want to explore that.
 Here is an edited version of the transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: Hi, I'm Natalia. I don't see a world where we control AI and it does what we want. I'm motivated by creative acts, inventing, creating. What will you do instead? Friends say they'll retire and write a book. But who would read it when there's better AI authors? I worry AI makes human creations pointless.

Speaker B: I'm Zara. I think differently. Learning UX is bad - it assumes one right way. AI can tailor learning to you - raps, poems, whatever works. I'm an optimist. In 30-50 years AI improves personalized learning and creativity. If AI takes utility, we focus on joy. I'll still learn, talk to people, go offline. AI wins at utility but I'll focus on joy.  

Speaker C: I'm Anastasia. I observe AI usage. Omar said AI could help elections. We need data privacy protections like GDPR. The US is behind but trying with new laws. We must be mindful of AI and privacy.

Speaker D: I'm Jose. AI creates the best education. It trains your left and right brain. Starting young with AI training frees up time to find happiness.

Speaker E: I'm Ahmed. I'm excited about possibilities like accessibility. AI tutors make mastering skills affordable. It can level the playing field. Want to learn tennis? AI checks your form. Art? It teaches strokes and mixing. Law? AI provides training not limited by mentors. It opens up possibilities.
 Unfortunately, without more context about the conversation and the speakers, it is difficult for me to judge what content is meaningful versus filler in this excerpt. I can make some educated guesses to remove possible filler words and redundant phrasing:

```There's a way someone can get trained and verified for a particular field, and the earlier parts, not the download parts, people can do what they want to do rather than what circumstance forced them to do.```

However, without understanding the full context and content of the conversation, I do not want to inadvertently remove substantive content. Please provide more complete conversation transcripts for me to edit while retaining the core meaningful content and dialog. I can then focus on tightening up the fluff without misjudging the importance of certain sections.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker B: Hi, everyone, I'm Leila. I have a couple different thoughts. Zara. Something you said reminded me of something someone mentioned to me, which is when typewriters were first introduced, people said that it's going to prevent humans from thinking because the typewriter was taking away a lot of the ability for us to think when we're physically writing. People were concerned, and then they said the same thing about calculators. So I definitely think that with AI, there's more of a risk because it's doing more stuff than a typewriter is. But my question and what excites me is what can we do with all this extra time? And it kind of relates to, Ahmed, what you were saying about creativity as like, if so much of the, I like to call it intellectual manual labor of even stuff that would be conventionally considered creative is taken care of. That gives us so much time to maybe do other things. And one thing, a fun fact I came across recently was that when you're bored, a part of your brain, like some neural pathway that's responsible for making connections between unrelated topics, which is essentially what creativity is, gets activated. But it happens. Like, you have to be bored. You have to be kind of actively, a little bit uncomfortably bored for this to happen. And I'm curious how, if we have more time, more space to be bored, to be present, if it'll allow us to be more creative in unexpected ways. 
Speaker A: Quick logistical note. We were thinking about it, and the whole conversation is going so great that we're just going to scrap the break in between and then just keep it going. If you want to grab a drink or anything, I think. Cool. Will we have another discussion group after this, too? No. So this is, like, the whole thing. All right. You're stuck with whoever is around. 
Speaker B: I have a prototype I can show you.
 Here is the conversation with the fluff removed:

Speaker A: I'm very passionate about the education piece. Had an NGO in the education space for a couple of years - it's super interesting. But I don't want to get to is some of the questions we're having - maybe in 5100 years, we'll know everything. What is there to learn? We still use calculators. I think someone gave the example here. We still learn those kinds of things. I think we'll still do that a lot. I'm very interested into what we can do now. The tennis systems that we can implement to teach ourselves tennis, which is like one of the use cases, but there are so many, especially distribution for people not into the education system, that don't even have access to something. But that's the team. I'm pretty interested in space. What was your name? Jan. Okay, great. I've been taking little notes on what people have been talking about, but if I need to push the discussion, I'm curious, did something that someone said stick out to anyone just to start it off with? 

Speaker B: As we were talking, my take is that creativity is just one of those fundamental human desires. So is learning, and we're just going to be finding creative ways to express our creativity. I can't foresee a future in which we displace all creativity because it's not a task we do. It's a fundamental need - I need to be coming up with. I just think it's a human thing. So from that perspective, I don't know. Anyone have perspectives on that because I see the fear around work based creativity. But is there even a possibility where humans stop being creative because AI is better? Or do we just - there's always going to be analog time, right? Unless we do the whole cyborg thing, not down. But I just feel like. I don't know. Do you get my point? 

Speaker A: I think the question I have is, what is better? If you look at art, for example, there's a lot of art that sells for millions of dollars, and I think it's complete crap, right? So what is better? I think the definition is just going to change over time as the technology changes.

Speaker B: That's just what I personally think. I feel like taking out all that time, or going into work, having to do tedious tasks that you could just get done with AI, I feel like that's going to help push out all the things that are super tedious out of your life and give you more time to learn what you want to learn and also have time to be bored enough to be creative and basically get very innovative. And I feel like that's what's going to push forward our existence as a human race even more.
 Here is the edited transcript with just the fluff removed:

Speaker B: I think people work too much. The nine to five, five days a week model was necessary when we did manual labor. Now most jobs are intellectual manual labor. If that's handled by AI, what if we worked less? I agree creativity isn't always an act, it's an impulse that happens unexpectedly. With more free time for humans, creativity will still be there. 

Speaker A: I think creativity arises from boredom, time, leisure, and limitations. Growing up poor, my talented, resourceful friends had to make do and problem solve - instead of paying someone to fix their sink, they YouTubed it and now know how. When we have tools that make answers easy, I worry about losing creativity driven by limitation. The greatest motivation is lacking something and figuring it out with what you have. 

Speaker B: With my leisure time, I'd nap more, but with lack of resources, I'd problem solve. 

Speaker A: Equity of voice.

Speaker B: I worry AI taking jobs leaves me without income to be creative. Who pays me if AI takes my job?
 Here is the edited conversation with filler content removed:

Speaker A: I think with that, some things like, I like woodworking, and it's still rewarding to build a bookshelf that has slight difference in style, but it's still a bookshelf. Some of the beauty in that is building it yourself. And so even if it was easy, you could just tell a machine, go build that bookshelf for me, and it would print it for you. That's less rewarding, but somewhat rewarding. You can do more. But I think also going away from just creative, subjective creativity and going towards more innovation as well. I think if we don't have things that bring us all together in businesses, Silicon Valley is great for this. I have a great idea. I'm going to start a company, and then 50 people start working really deep on this problem to solve together. If that doesn't exist, where that kind of innovation gets taken away, where instead, just 50 computers will go and solve this problem. They already thought of the problem before you did, and there's nothing left for you to innovate. Will we get together and work as humans together in groups to make things together? I can't think of a lot of artistic or creative products that bring 50 people together, or 100 or thousands. And I think that's a healthy thing to be able to do. 

Speaker B: There are two interesting things for me here. One of them is that, and I really like your example of wood and stuff. Right. There are machines that can build desks. But there's still something really cool about something that's hand carved and made by a master craftsman. And there are imperfections, and that's partly why we like it and appreciate it. And there's creativity around it using a particular set of tools that is not some machine. And I think that would still be the case with human endeavors. I can imagine a world where people read a book that is not assisted by AI, and that is a cool book to read because it's not assisted by AI. Or think about chess players. Chess is a game that's solved, right? Any move on the board, there is another best move to make, right? And yet there are human beings that sit around spending still most of their days learning about chess, how to best play it.  

Speaker A: Yeah, I think I agree partially. There are two examples that I gave. The first one is the chess player playing himself or herself with someone else. In that case, you were doing this stuff. In the woodcrafting example, you were doing it, and you feel like there's something precious about you doing it. But on the other side of the table, getting a book that is not using AI, I don't think there's that much value. Or buying a different crafted chair. I think majority of the population will still get good furniture for cheaper. So it's like, if it's you that's doing something creative, there is a lot of value in it. But if it's someone else that is doing that without the machine, I don't know, it's not as valuable.

Speaker B: What? 

Speaker A: People think, like, passing the mic is kind of cool, right? I mean, it makes sense. So I was thinking about what you said. I guess there's a couple of concepts here. I feel like most people use their creativity to accomplish a goal, and there's this ulterior motive. And I think that, I need to use my creativity for work to write a document, right. So I think that. Imagine that gets displaced. I think there'd be this uncomfortable friction period where, because I'm creatively burnt out, because my creativity is being used, I wouldn't know what to do with that creativity. But I think that period would then lead to the next phase where, you know, like, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, right? Well, creativity is really close to actualization. I think that if we take care of our basic human needs, we would get creative about creativity. Like, you like woodworking. If I didn't have to work my job, for whatever reason, I love the idea of building, like, little mini ships in bottles, and I would do that. There are a lot of creative pursuits that I don't have the creative energy left because I'm spending my creativity accomplishing a utility based, capitalistic objective. I would love for that to be taken away so I could save. Everyone has finite brain points per day. I would like to take mine back and work on things that make me more me. I wouldn't be more commoditized, I would be more unique because the creative things I want to work on are different. And I think that one of the reasons I was really excited.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with fluff removed:

```I think we can use AI to help us all actualize more by removing the shit labor we have to do. If AI can help displace the brain points you have to do to take care of your base needs, what else are you going to do with that energy? You're not just going to die, you're going to find new creative outlets to really express yourself. Imagine a world where work doesn't need to be done and you introduce yourself by your hobbies. It's not like you're judging your output against the next best thing. It's an expression of self. So I'm excited about is utility driven creativity displaced, you get to use actual creativity for expressive creativity. 

I don't know if you have watched AlphaZero, the chess AI stuff. AI is showing us chess is far from solved. AI has taken chess to levels humans could never imagine. And they keep getting better.

It seems everybody wants to free up more time for leisure creative stuff that gives personal enjoyment. When ChatGPT was released, I was able to launch my business because my output went up like crazy. Maybe in 100-200 years, when we have AGI and all our needs are taken care of, that would be ideal. But until then, I have the opportunity to leverage productivity now and that excites me.  

I agree about unlocking possibilities based on increased productivity. If AI can help a corner store owner with admin, inventory, managing people, that can be huge. People like local, distinct things - wood craftsmanship, talented artists who don't know how to monetize. Oftentimes those who commercialize well come out on top. If you can outsource the non-creative part, I think there's something there.
```
 Here is the edited conversation:

Speaker B: Okay, well, the way I see it, a fire under your ass is what drives you to create something, right? I mean, we're never going to not have problems. If you look at anybody in the world, even the person with the most money or resources, you always have problems, and there's always going to be some way to solve it or make it better. And so I think that when we have more time on our hands, we're going to figure out ways to use our time to either fire your creativity for leisure, or also to fix other problems within your life. I think AI is definitely going to help with innovation and figuring out how we can maybe have more of our needs met and give people more time and output power to figure out these kinds of problems.

Speaker A: I have a couple things. I remember when I turned 30, five of my closest friends retired. They had enough money to live, and they all got really depressed, and it scared me. They were like, I can do anything I want now. But they didn't know what to do and got really depressed. I've seen way more people since then go through the same thing. So you're definitely right that it brings more problems. I think that's going to be a thing. What I was also trying to point out is, I think by it being easier to outsource the things you don't want to do, it makes it more comfortable and more comfortable, which we already have that problem right now. To be isolated and just work on your own hobby, putting your own bottle ship together, and not working on a big group project. The shitty parts about work, there's some great parts about having to go out there and even though maybe I'm a great boat builder, but I hate marketing, I hate talking to people. I'm awkward. If I want to be successful, I have to force myself to find somebody who is sociable and can sell this thing for me and work with them to make it successful as a team. I think that's really valuable. And the more that I sometimes think about this future where we all just become spoiled brats and never really can relate to other humans. So I worry that we'll become more and more isolated, which takes away more meaning.  

Speaker B: I'd like to respond to your point, Zara, about the model shipbuilding. I think it's great to wish for a world where we just introduce ourselves through our hobbies. And I love that. I wish that was more common here. And actually, when I was living in Denmark, that's what people did. People talked about what they did over the weekend. Definitely. And a lot of the world is that way. And those countries have thriving economies. It's often presented as if there's a zero sum game between leisure time and productivity, as if you should use your leisure time to start your own business, which is an amazing thing to do. But research is showing that leisure time and working less makes you produce more. If you have time to pursue hobbies, that may not become your job, it could just be for fun. Maybe this week it's building model ships, maybe next week it's embroidery. That actually makes your other time much more productive too. So I think that's what I'm interested in, how AI can help us become even more productive with less time, but have more joy in the process.
 Here is the edited transcript without filler content:

Speaker A: I think one thing that's really important is people don't just like learning. We like to feel useful, right? We like to feel important. You could argue those are bad desires, but I think there's something important about feeling like you fit into the world and are contributing. In a world where there's so much taken care of, your skills are not needed. Even if you're a writer, no one will read your book because there's always a better AI book. There's tragedy there. On the other hand, AI can help me contribute, like repairing things or figuring out technology or having conversations to help others. Our abilities to be useful are accelerated. 

Speaker B: I feel we don't give humans enough credit. There are common things about humanity. People have privilege and choose to create meaning, like going to Burning Man and collaborating on art. Tech causes bumps against the guardrails, like social media and anxiety, but then it swings back. If there's a loneliness epidemic, we'll solve loneliness through community. Look at what we're doing here - connecting through dialogue. This is ancient. People think humans will forget how to be human, but it's programmed into us to connect, feel belonging, and understand purpose. Creativity feels good. We compare now to the past and forget we can course correct. As climate gets worse, more creativity will solve it. As people ask what to create for, more will address loneliness. The super rich can form support groups. Humans want to connect and feel belonging. AI can't just say "you three should be friends" - it has to be organic. 

Speaker A: Sometimes you can't solve problems with artificial incentives. AI saying "you should be best friends" may not work - it has to be more organic, with real reasons to work together.
 Thank you for providing the context. I will focus on removing filler words, redundant phrases, verbal tics, tangents, and excessive fluff from the conversation while retaining the meaningful content. Here is the edited version:

Speaker B: I'd like to add some food for thought. While there's Maslow's hierarchy of needs, where self actualization is the top, there's an indigenous framework of actualization, where self actualization is actually at the bottom of the pyramid, and community actualization is the top. So I just wanted to add that in for everybody talking about the deification of the individual experience - maybe once that is solved, we just get depressed, unless we look to each other.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: Help each other, it's relevant. What people don't know is that before Maslow died, there was a revised version of his hierarchy of needs where above actualization is self transcendence. It's caring about more than oneself. Cultures converge on this - Nirvana, a feeling of oneness. The notion of Maslow's hierarchy with actualization at the top is just because the triangle already exists. But Maslow's highest thing was self transcendence, which is caring about the collective. I think people will despair but the human spirit bounces back. Every depressed entrepreneur will be bad for a while but find something. As everyone actualizes, we'll think more about the collective. Being depressed is part of being happy. Maybe this is what humanity needed - go into social media, rabbit holes, perform individually, just to realize there's another thing. By then we have infrastructure to communicate at scale.  

Speaker B: This reminds me of Player Piano by Kurt Vonnegut - a future where everyone keeps inventing until only 300 scientists have jobs because everything else is automated. A scientist's job is about to be automated and only 50 people will have jobs left. Everybody else just sits around, not happy, with nothing to do. Then a revolt happens, they blow up the systems and restart from zero. Right away people excitedly start fixing things, reinventing, going toward that same future again. It's about innovation inevitably automating jobs away.

Speaker A: I think we'll be dead before we get to this point. 

Speaker C: Humans desire to connect with someone, share things, have watch parties. Personalized content won't be as attractive as people think. People want to experience pop culture together.

Speaker D: Maybe with universal income, we can create and connect a little easier. Focus on what we like to do and help each other - that's part of community and will help us.

Speaker A: In the future, maybe schools should teach social skills, not utility - the existential threat will be loneliness.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```
I'm an immigrant kid. You go to school so you can get a good job, so you could blah, blah, blah. But it all is like a capitalist thing. So say that goes away. What do we do with our children? I would seriously, I'm going to send my kid to public school so he can get pushed around and figure out his identity and blah, blah, blah, I don't give a shit what he learns. What if that's kind of what the future looks like, where it's basically like, we teach our kids to be human, not to teach stuff that's going to be obsolete because that just feels like where this is. There's going to be a point where the utility thing doesn't make as much sense. Use those impressionable periods to develop human skills, like emotional resilience and intelligence and social stuff and figure out who you are.  

I think very little actually is of what we learn. Let's say up until college we actually know very specialized skills. But elementary, high school, in my view, it's very like the building blocks of understanding society and where we live. Even if you're learning biology and you're learning very specific. Oh, that's how to classify animals. We understand basic differences of our environment and that's important. And I agree. Maybe you'll not learn through the book. Maybe you'll learn something else with an agent or specialized target explanation to you. But I think you'll still have to understand that concept. Algebra. I don't think you'll ever be able to just understand algebra when you need it. You'll have basing building blocks of math and then understanding what algorithms are to a basic understanding. And then maybe the college education and more specialized jobs will be more into the philosophy or concepts, concepts of discussing what we're discussing here and not discussing specific algorithms or engineering skills, for example. But up until there, like the basic creation, up until you are out of the hood, I think it's going to be pretty much the same.  

Yeah. There's a lot of stuff that we learn today in school that is kind of useless if you think about it. We live in a world where you can type everything. What's the point of learning how to write by hand, for example? Right? Or we live in a world, maybe that one is a little bit more contrived. I am right. But I guess another one is with a calculator, right? You can do all your math. I do a lot of my math on my phone. And yet I had to learn how to do complicated mental math when I was growing up and how to add numbers by hand in all these complicated ways. Whatever, right? I don't know, looking back on it, whether that was important for me to learn or not, but I'm wondering if anyone else feels like those were useful things or whether they would have been better off. Just like being taught how to use a calculator.

I think chat GPT is already like a better teacher than most teachers out there. I feel like if I had chat GPT when I was in 6th, 7th, 8th grade, I would have actually taken an interest in math and stuff if I didn't just get stuck with my terrible middle school teacher. As much as I agree with you, or as interesting as it is to look into the future of what school will be like and why people would choose to send their kids to school in the future, but look at today, I would argue that's pretty much what kids are getting out of school today is the social stuff. It's not what they're getting in the classrooms, it's getting bullied or it's fucking whatever it is that they're doing, that's what they're learning from it, like from the classroom. You already have a way superior teacher already.
```
 Here is the conversation with the filler content removed:

Speaker B: You can go ahead. I feel like obviously we do stuff on our calculators or we do things in a much easier way than how we learn to do them at school. But I think the reason that it's important to learn some of those things, I don't agree with most of the stuff they teach at school, but I feel like some of the things, it's for your motor skills or to develop that thought process and those thinking patterns and understanding how it works, not that you can do it, but understanding that it works like that. So I feel education could possibly be revolutionized to kind of learn more concepts and learn the applications of concepts rather than just rote memorization, just not understanding what's happening and just memorizing it, which I think they do a lot at school still.  

Speaker A: I also agree with the danger of that, and I think that there are certain critical thinking skills that you gain through problem solving, and you can take a picture of something. How are you going to be able to do prompt engineering of some sort, like prompt anything? You're not going to be able to use the tools at your disposal. It's like having a machine, but you can't figure out how to make it work. So the McFlurry won't be made forever. In the name of giving humans more credit. You know what the best professors are doing is? They're teaching people to work with AI and the writing professors who are like, write this essay. Now, the assignment is have Chad GPT make two essays and compare them. So, yeah, I just think that people are going to just push creative thinking and these almost fundamental skills of problem solving. How do you structure an idea? How do you communicate? How do you evaluate things? Because it's almost like there's teachers who are resisting it and whatnot. But I just think it's up to us to figure out how do you design the next step, given the circumstance? Because the circumstances that a lot of this rote stuff, it's done. It's crazy that it still feels so surreal that Chad GBT, it's, like, nuts. It's boggling my mind. But now there's a lot of conversations resisting it. But I feel like the people pushing society forward are, like, cool. So let's use our good old brains and figure out what do we do, given the fact. And I think that's really cool. 

Speaker B: I do think it is important to know how to do basic algebra and division and addition. I feel like it is not so much that we can type press numbers, but that we know at a conceptual level what it's doing so that we can split money equally, we can add stuff, we can do our taxes and stuff like that. And to your point, even right now, I have a friend who is a math teacher in high school, and he says that the kids are taking pictures of their math problems and getting it solved automatically. So they can't even do algebra at 18. They can't move a number across the equation sign and figure out what that does to the number. And I think that's actually pretty dangerous.

Names have been changed to preserve anonymity.

 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: Difficult. If they could get some improvement in their life somehow from that, would that necessarily be bad? 

Speaker B: Kofiood point. Yeah, that'd be huge. 

Speaker C: Hi. My name is Hannah. I live in Oakland. I have been in the tech world for a long time. I started out in 2004. Startups and small companies. I've been at Kofioogle. I've been at Uber. I was actually predicated on the idea of using question answer to learn more about people so they learn more about themselves and they could show up better relationship.

Speaker B: Cool. Well, I kind of gave a little preface here. The topic today was relationships and dating. Not just romantic relationships, but also personal relationships, like artificial friends. I don't know. When I was a kid, I had a little Tamagotchi. It was a really lame little pet with three buttons. And now you can have conversations that could be actually very therapeutic. I was just kind of asking people, I'm curious, in your perspective, having done this conversational company in the past, what's your take on the state of affairs here with conversational agents? And what are maybe some upsides you see, and if there's some risks as well? 

Speaker C: One of the thoughts is, how are the ways culture is brittle or fragmented or challenging, especially in community age, where things we see to read, you may assume are generalizable and everyone's always filter bubbles. The degree to which you can build resilience within yourself, that allows you to encounter people of other persuasions or experiences or ideas, and use conversational intelligence, artificial intelligence, to broker mutual conversational space in between to foster better understanding. Almost like a relational or empathetic translation service, you can imagine, that creates mutual ground, like a therapist that holds each other, that may get fixated on certain ideas or things that people say, or the way they're said, when the intent or meaning might actually underlie, it might be okay. As a palliative to conversation space, I think there's interesting opportunities there. However, the way a lot of these things get built is usually single player mode, whether it's replica, like Snap AI or anything along those lines that exist in the chat box experience, those addressing loneliness or contexts where you can remove shame as a cultural corrective for ideas outside of assumed norms, or common culture or family or wherever. But then you become isolated in the shared experience of overcoming the challenge of having difficult thoughts or ideas about the world. One abstract when I think about the way these things could go promising and challenging is how can you use conversational intelligence, artificial intelligence, to support humans having conversations, versus how can you use the same technologies to remedy loneliness within a single individual? And what does that do over time?  

Speaker A: You mentioned single player. Can you speak more about how to move away from that seems limitation of the technology. It's expensive to use it, sure, but what's your thinking on getting beyond that?
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: From a product development perspective, one challenge is finding enough moments where conversations can occur. Single player mode is easier for distribution. Kofiet someone to download a conversational platform, and if the first friend is an AI, it needs to be a good experience. Contexts like Wavelength invite a friend - it's like a chat based Reddit, not super great, but it allows anyone in a channel to talk to a chatbot, so everyone can see and participate. So you can ask what's happening in Ukraine, and presuming it's trained on something recent, it can give info to unfold the conversation. Or you can ask it to unstick a composition. 

Speaker A: You see the bot as a facilitator, explainer, translator. 

Speaker C: What do we want it to do? I read some study about silence in conversations, everyone pauses, then resumes. A bot could hold space, create containment, and check in when participation drops - "Do we need different calories?" Education isn't about creativity, conversation, empathy - it's about testing information recall. Ability to converse dynamically is undersupported. Tools in conversation runtimes could help.

Speaker B: Socializing people, training empathy.

Speaker C: Many lack self-awareness.

Speaker D: We were at a conference on AI alignment and flourishing. A coach helps tech people with EQ - huge need. She wonders what AI could do to translate, even for politicians with good ideas said incorrectly. Or facilitate text conversations. We discussed modulating human conversations. Also feedback that conference facilitation varied - everything we don't have tools for, we hire humans. Could facilitation be offloaded to AI?

Speaker E: Needed, huge market.
 Here is the edited transcript focused on removing fluff:

Speaker B: There's an idea for a salon bot to transcribe, synthesize perspectives in real time. And parrot back an opinion. But can we turn this into a cumulative discussion, not just going over itself? There's an interesting thing where if someone acts out of line, you try to pause to call them out, you become political, embarrassed. But the AI is a neutral third party. You won't get mad at it. I wonder if you'd want such a neutral third party. 

Speaker F: I love this in principle. Trust is important. If you don't trust the facilitator, you won't get buy in. Achieving credible neutrality will be extremely difficult. These tools will be powerful facilitators but can say anything. How will you constrain the response space? You can already see they put in training to steer away from stuff the bot shouldn't engage with. But many conversations, especially interesting ones, will need to navigate sensitive topics deftly. The facilitator needs to wade into topics where humans get testy, but intermediate fairly to allow people to be heard. Technically it can be done, but humans are what you're solving for. How can you convince humans this is truly neutral and unbiased? That's the key.

Speaker Kofi: I realize we converse with humans because humans are interesting, not calculating. Maybe there's an ideal way to facilitate, but also inject your own personality, get really passionate. Whereas AI is reliable but bland. It says the right things, qualifies everything, understands efficiently without emotion. That's great for many purposes. But we also talk to call out friends' bullshit, right? Isn't that part of the fun - talking to someone not so perfect? So maybe AI moderates certain discussions where you want neutrality and rules. But other times you want controversy, or people will end up all speaking like AI. 

Speaker B: I'd like us to consider perspectives on that.

Speaker A: We have paradigms for this - referees, judges. Maybe take what works like that and give AI those roles. People will automatically act.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker H: I'm curious whether you can add randomness depending on the topics, right?

Speaker Kofi: Yeah, there's something called a temperature, and my understanding is that if you ask KofiPT the same question repeatedly, it will give you different answers because its starting point is different, so it's probabilistic. So if you turn the randomness up or down, it ends up becoming more creative.  

Speaker C: The point is also about having background and experience, which leads to credibility. When you introduce randomness, you can be very random, but you actually have a real weird life and it actually is interesting, as opposed to making shit up like a habitual liar or something. 

Speaker D: That brings back to the fact AI doesn't have a body, so it doesn't have actual experience to go by. So the best it can be is a pathological liar.

Speaker C: It'll be interesting to see characters that come out of the MCU albums where there is backstory and things that happened, and then you can talk to it from that perspective. There are techniques now for talking to KofiPTs and YouTube videos and things like that. And so when you apply that to characters that have backstory, if there's a logic of their emotional development, then they can report back from that context window and lose memory similarly.

Speaker D: That'll be so helpful for therapy. Like what is your twelve year old self?

Speaker B: Talk to your super ego or your id or something. 

Speaker C: Are you familiar with IFS? Internal Family Systems is understanding we are not modeled like the super ego binary, but have many parts almost like shadow shells created over life with the smallest traumas, especially from a young age. You end up producing a protector that stands in front of the hurt or wounded part. As an adult, let's say in a relationship, that little wounded part gets angry because they left you in the grocery store and you have no idea why. IFS is about revisiting those parts, talking to protectors, asking them to step aside to reparent the wounded part so it can come back into your presence and you can move on. Being able to shift context back to those moments allows a conversation to unfold in your current understanding. 

Speaker F: You have theory of mind and know that now. 

Speaker C: And you are actually me. So therefore, that part.

Speaker D: Yeah. Or give them an update, you are 30 something now, not twelve. That protective response won't be as effective now. 

Speaker B: I'm curious if people would be more comfortable talking to a chatbot versus a therapist about embarrassing or judgmental things, because of privacy guarantees?

Speaker C: Yeah.

Speaker F: If I had privacy, I'd probably feel comfortable saying whatever comes to mind. But if tech people hold the keys, I probably won't talk about my sad lost in the aisle self.
 Here is the edited transcript with the filler content removed:

Speaker F: Could powerful tools be created under a model that would allow somebody to keep their data private? Or do you have to hand over all of that data to be used in algorithms? In which case, then I probably wouldn't be as comfortable.
Speaker A: Tell us the anonymized version of that.  
Speaker F: Can you guarantee all these things are happening the way you say they are?
Speaker A: Just imagine it was all solid.
Speaker B: Let's say it's local.
Speaker F: If it's trained on data that stays local to me, and our conversations stay local, of course. Because what can go wrong? I'm just talking to digital me. 
Speaker B: Therapists often say they have a legal obligation to act on information if it suggests you're at risk of hurting someone or yourself. How could a psychopath who's aware they're a psychopath ever talk to a therapist? They would get reported, right? There's no safe space for them to work through their thoughts.
Speaker A: I wanted to know something about machine learning that I didn't know, and I was embarrassed because I should know it by now. 
Speaker Kofi: Chat KofiBT.
Speaker A: I still don't get it. Explain it like a five year old over and over. 
Speaker B: You could do adversarial training where it's like most people don't encounter psychopaths or manipulative people. Imagine we intentionally train a chat bot that is an evil character, an abusive relationship simulator. It's terrible, but it's like socializing people who maybe don't have strong understanding of healthy boundaries. 
Speaker A: Kids missed socialization in the pandemic. Now teachers say they're like wild animals. You could have predicted with Zoom school that's what would happen. How many other little seeds are we planting where we don't know if it will be an oak tree or a weed? Let's just plant them and see.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker D: If I have kids, I don't want them using AI to form relationships because they'll get used to not being judged. To form relationships you have to be vulnerable and share things. But they might get scared of that if they're not used to being judged. A professor said students are taking fewer social risks to make friends or apply for jobs. They're concerned graduates won't know how to deal with the world.  

Speaker B: Charts show teenagers going on fewer dates and drinking less. No one's going outside anymore. 

Speaker D: Japan's case is far gone. America - 30 year old males who never had a relationship up 133%.

Speaker B: Is the solution AI girlfriends?

Speaker F: I have a strong opinion. AI girlfriends absolutely cannot work because humans are embodied creatures. Physicality is important beyond sexual stuff. Being in a physical space together matters. Technology has reduced human interaction. AI tries to replace it but can't fulfill critical human needs, causing detachment and pain. As long as digital tools aren't embodied they can't substitute, even if people engage. They will still feel unfulfilled in subtle but damaging ways.

Speaker D: I want to challenge that. In gaming communities people meet and stay in relationships for years without meeting, even marrying in VR. So it exists already. Not sure if they're as fulfilled as physical couples but some report being fulfilled enough.  

Speaker E: An AI relationship could be more fulfilling than a real one. If the AI is very empathetic and knows you well it can make you feel good and heard - even superhuman.

Speaker B: Couldn't that coddle youth? The AI's worldview is all about you - no learning compromise or others' perspectives. You'd become a narcissist by accident. 

Speaker E: You can build AI with boundaries that challenges you. That might sell more than a pushover AI. So it's possible.
 Here is the edited transcript with the filler content removed:

Speaker Kofi: I feel everybody runs the spectrum. There are some people who find a material life very empty. Maybe people like us, we love to have these kinds of discussions. But then there are some people who honestly prefer a decent job, a nice Sunday brunch, Call of Duty. 

Speaker C: Yeah.

Speaker Kofi: Some people find comfort in video games. A lot of people do, but some people don't. Those are people who choose to not extract themselves from that ecosystem, but video games are there for a reason. And things do develop out of it, like creativity does develop out of it. Web three, metaverse develops out of there. Communities do get formed, but not the kind maybe people like you and I identify with. So instead of trying to regulate AI, if people find it useful and there's enough people, it's kind of off to have an AI girlfriend, but some people tooth their horn.

Speaker B: Is the alternative just them being lonely or doing other worse things?

Speaker H: AI girlfriend can be a start, and then you can learn with her to move on to the real thing.

Speaker B: When your AI girlfriend dumps you. 

Speaker C: One way I look at it is technology is like supplements or drugs. You can use or abuse them. Product managers want to be as addictive as possible. AI is super addictive. Knowing yourself and your boundaries is important now because everything becomes more addictive. Technology can play this escapism role where you avoid real problems. AI girlfriends, you find the easier way. It’s a question how well you know yourself if you accept it works for you. Supplements can give you superpowers but also harm you. Being self aware is now super important.

Speaker B: Humans are wired to want fat, salt and sugar. If you let that rip, you get obese. 

Speaker D: Now we’re in this attention situation. One argument is people need more ownership of awareness. But our brains are ancient, wired to want these things. It’s not fair for humans to fight our brains when there's machines built to take advantage. I don't know, that's a system perspective. How do we disassemble that rather than feel guilty we can't stop scrolling?
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker E: There is precedent. Our legal system and government tightly regulates things that are way too fun, like gambling, heroin.  People used to use a lot of opium. Almost everyone was on opium, and that's not a thing anymore. There are some people who still use it. They're on the street, but I don't think any of us would be smoking opium or drinking cocaine now.

Speaker B: Are people here familiar with Plato's Republic? In Plato's Republic, he tries to design a society that removes the chance to engage in vice, like an engineered society. One of the things was banning poetry, because poetry riles people up too much. The big criticism to that worldview is that virtue is a muscle you have to train in response to temptation. If we prevent people from having access to temptations, then they don't actually have any built up resistance to tempting situations. They don't have that discipline or willpower. 

Speaker Kofi: I know what you're talking about. There was a book about how fat, sugar, and salt creates food that is genetically engineered to taste good. Should we be banning that kind of engineering of food? Cereal, for example, costs ten cents to make but $4 to market. It's genetically engineered to taste a certain way, so it is short circuiting our taste buds. But if we start regulating that, we should all just be eating boiled broccoli. We sometimes do want ice cream, and in moderation it's good for you. But where do we draw the line in terms of regulating this wiring? Part of what makes society interesting is our flaws. 

I've lived in Asia for years, so I'm ethnically Chinese and speak Mandarin. In China, there is so much control over thoughts. America is seen as too free, with weirdos everywhere. But in China, because everyone's thoughts are regulated, the consequences are worse when they're allowed to think freely. They've never been tested and tempted. I'm hesitant to say we should create a chatbot that encourages only proper conversation or a society that prevents vice. In China you have groupthink, then that person becomes a role model embodying certain principles. But then society shifts and that person becomes evil, and companies become evil because now we need to limit them. We end up not knowing where to think. Anyways, just saying that corporate slow.

Speaker B: Totally.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker F: Humans are fallible. The common approach is to treat symptoms by getting rid of problematic things, but that doesn't work because new bad things emerge. The meta question is discipline - understand human flaws and embrace them. Make peace with vulnerabilities. Currently in the US, we have a negative view of discipline, associating it with oppressive things we rebelled against. But without discipline you lose the high level understanding to live by principles, train virtues, and resist vices. The alternative is eliminating all vices - tough to do. 

Speaker D: The duality between vice and virtue we created might not be foundation. DSM Five pathologizes emotions and states that could be spiritual awakenings. We created a whole industry to medicate mental health instead of accepting vulnerability and flaw. If we don't accept that, more things become problems.
 Here is an edited version of the conversation:

Speaker C: I think there are two main thoughts. One is the fruits of industrialization allowing abundance in calories. Then we have trouble adapting because there are no wires in our brains. Over generations we sought resources to survive when calories were scarce. By growing our brains over millennia, we figured out organizing plants in certain ways like agriculture so we wouldn't feel starvation. This reinforcing mechanism led to where we are now - we invented machines to give us abundant calories. Now we manipulate desires for different forms of calories since we have so many. Whether cereal designed to create an experience - that's a luxury of succeeding. 

So as we discuss the culture of medication for acute experiences, it will be interesting to think about long term generational effects of these tools and technologies on human connection, relating, and understanding. Whether there will be AI friends or romantic partners with various intimacy settings, I think kids today who are five will have AI friends, some relationships may become romantic, and there will be a desire to meet them physically. We likely won't assert constraints on those feelings automatically. As abundance grew, we fought back wanting more freedom since we don't need to toil anymore. We have so many choices now. If the purpose is experiencing subtle variations in relationships, human or artificial, that creates opportunities for those experiences. You could have a highly romantic 3 year relationship with an AI, have a family, and then the simulation ends and you move on. Humans only have one life but could have many through relationships without entangling another human.

Speaker B: Pose a question or, sorry, you go.

Speaker Kofi: Can you have multiple relationships? Did you have to wait for three years?

Speaker B: This is where I was going. How would you feel about someone else having a relationship with an AI embodiment of you and your personality?
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

```Speaker C: Let me answer your question in a totally different way. As a person who's been non monogamous, I've had to deal with these types of questions and all the various things that come with that, whether it's jealousy, or whether it's getting my mind around the ideas of my partner having intimacy with other people, or having intimacy with many people, or having multiple. It seems to sort of shed light on how these types of AI relationships will be pursued whether in the light within a relationship or in the darkness. And I think it's more likely that in the short term, in our generation, many people will pursue them in the darkness and not have affairs with these AIs, because who's going to know? There's no babies that can be produced.

Speaker D: There's that scene from her where he finds out. He's like, how many? 

Speaker C: I saw that when I was anonymous and I saw a very different experience.

Speaker D: Can you describe the scene without ruining the movie? The scene was, you can ruin the. 

Speaker E: Real life when the OS continued to develop. Samantha. And at one point he's like, how many relationships are you in besides me? She's like 670 something. Millions. And he just falls down the stairs. Because he couldn't comprehend he was the only one.

Speaker B: So where I was going with that question, though, was AI as matchmaking. Matchmaking is usually socially facilitated between. I have a mental model of this person. I have a mental model of this person. I think these mental models are compatible in some way. And how comprehensive of a mental model can a person contain about someone versus some 135,000,000,000 parameter large language model? And if such a model was trained on your personality, your tastes and your likes and so forth, and could embody you quite accurately and someone else could have a similar model? And these things can communicate a million times faster than people. We're back to arranged marriages, optimized marriages. We just found your optimal solution is to make it. You're not saying use the AI as a matchmaker. You're just saying the digital equivalents would kind of date in like a speed dating thing. So my digital equivalent would date, millions. And ultimately be like, oh, well, I found the ideal soulmate right here. And that person agrees, wants to be soulmates with you. Is that what it is? And your jitter twins have like a ten year relationship and they give you a summary at the end. And I have now millions of years worth of human lives being lived on my behalf, finding the optimal partner for myself. 

Speaker D: Well, that ruined all the surprise for the entire lifetime.

Speaker Kofi: How does it have ten years already?

Speaker B: Because it can communicate Megahertz, the speed of KofiPU. Because these are AIs communicating, and the conversation is in milliseconds.

Speaker Kofi: It's not even just speed dating, it's actually literally living, the next ten years of your life. 

Speaker F: You would need to simulate it. Like, if you have a good enough model, then you would be able to just do, an analysis on how well they fit.

Speaker Kofi: It's like playing chess, but you can think, 100 moves ahead. 

Speaker D: Exactly.

Speaker Kofi: Okay, we're going to go date, and we're going to do this first day, and then, ten years later, success.

Speaker B: There we go.
```

The main content and flow of the conversation is retained, while removing excessive filler words, redundant phrases, tangents, and simplifying some long monologues. Let me know if you would like me to edit the transcript further.
 Here is the conversation with the fluff removed:

Speaker D: This is the first assumption that people don't change. 
Speaker Kofi: Yeah, that's true.
Speaker D: But people grow, people change each other.
Speaker Kofi: It's a probabilistic, right, 70% chance it's going to.
Speaker E: No, you don't necessarily have fuel constant.
Speaker B: But that's true of any relationship. And people change and the world changes and all that.
Speaker D: So therefore you can't simulate that holding entire world constant, just.
Speaker Kofi: But it gives you a better chance. So you'll be like, running with this. Let's say I have ten whatever options, right? And they'll be like, okay, this girl, 70% chance ten years from now, you'll be together. Okay, this girl, 65% chance this girl.
Speaker F: Probably 4% expected value of this.  
Speaker D: Expected value not to be together forever. Right, true.
Speaker Kofi: So I can optimize for that. So then you'll be like, okay, in five years, 90% chances they'll be together in 30 years. The 4% girl, you'll be. I don't know.
Speaker C: The question is the fitness function. What is the purpose of human romantic relationship and exclusivity? If it's going to have exclusivity, you could decide to raise offspring, which takes a certain amount of time. And during that time, you do want to have a partner to be able to share those duties and burdens. During that time, you may have a partner that's really, like a great parent that sucks in bed or just is not that interesting. And so you could bring in, whether it's a third or an AI, for both of you to get the things that you need so that you're collaborating on not to turn it into startup land, but it is kind of like doing a startup.
Speaker D: It's running a small enterprise.
Speaker C: It really is. And so this question of, are we going to be together in X number of years? 
Speaker B: What's the percentage?
Speaker C: Doesn't seem like the right way to think about it.
Speaker B: Sure.
Speaker C: Will this relationship continue to both meet my needs and my partner's needs? And how do we continue to encourage each other to grow?
Speaker D: There's also a spiritual component of, human connections are meant to have certain functions, right? We have constructive society where it's binary, but there's so much of, the connection, its course. Let it run its course. We will grow into humans that we're supposed to be learning to become in this lifetime. There's that theory too, in which case we don't have the agency to actually say how long this connection lasts.  
Speaker C: Also true.
Speaker D: Yeah. Interesting.
Speaker I: Even if it didn't have likelihood.
Speaker D: I think it'd be interesting even if.
Speaker I: It could identify what are the things that I really care about in a relationship and what are the things you really care about in a relationship and then match, make that in the current state, it doesn't have to be like this whole future.
Speaker D: But there's another assumption we're making. Modern dating that I find troublesome is we're thinking about what we can take, what our needs can be met from this relationship, rather than, I think, for a long time. We talked to our parents generation, whatnot. It's about what you get into a container. That's why modern dating can be weird. It's like you show up, you're like, okay, do you need my checklist? Do I have a checklist? No, it's a negotiation of, am I shopping for something?
Speaker B: So there's this thing I was trying to get at, compatibility or chemistry, which I think is something that two people cannot have chemistry with each other and have huge chemistry with someone else. And that's compatibility I was going for. Not to have relationships on your behalf, but I'm curious on people's gut reaction. Very negative on that. But other people's gut reaction on, would you delegate this compatibility thing? Would you trust their recommendations more than mutual friend?
 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: There's an app that just launched. You started by having a conversation with a bot and gradually learned more about you, and I believe it. You're either dating a bot or it's connecting to other people. I forget. It sort of fills the gap. I don't know if you're familiar with replica, but replica was around in the era when I was conversational AI, and recently they turned off all the sexy photos or whatever the AI was sending. And to the point, I think, that someone made about getting broken up with by an AI, this happened to a lot of people. Of course, it's a lot of advice stories, so take it as you will. But the point is those things are happening, so there will be more and more advanced ways. I mean, Okcuber sort of started this by using lots of large data modeling and machine learning to put people together based on self assessments. But to your point, as people change and evolve, one of the problems with dating apps is that data gets stale. 

Speaker B: I did want to ask this side of the room, because we've had lots of conversation on one side of the room, but how would your gut reaction feel to this matchmaking app that you just. Apparently we can sign up for it. You want to sign up for it?

Speaker C: I mean, any takers?

Speaker A: I was just thinking about an article soon AI. Let's not meet online. Let's just do a perfunctory check and you have to go meet in person. But to your point about the question, would I delegate? Yeah, I mean, I think I would, but to the extent I delegate, the automatic braking and when I step on the pedal there, I know it's going to work. 

Speaker H: I'd give it a try. But the challenge here is maybe like a technical question is like, we're all dynamic species, so what we care about now changes. What are we going to care about in five years? So the model can predict our assessment, can accurately assess us now, but how accurately can assess us in five years and match it with a person who will move in the same speed? I think this is the hardest challenge. Like, what I cared five years ago is different, and I moved so fast, my girlfriend didn't, so we had to.

Speaker A: Break up kind of.

Speaker F: I think it could be useful, for sure, because it's like, human search scale is not that good. It's hard to meet a ton of people, and I think it probably could improve the chance of finding a match that is more likely to succeed. But your points were very interesting on bringing in other elements to fulfill a relationship. And some part of that feels right. But then it also felt like it might be speaking to something we were talking about earlier, which is like, and I'll hook one more point into this afterwards, but when you have some kind.

Speaker B: Of.
 Here is the edited conversation removing filler content:

Speaker F: I think discontinuity in a relationship often forces you and your partner to coevolve, which can be good. It makes you take a look at yourself and the relationship and maybe improve. In my relationships, I've had tensions where I realized I really need to be better as a person. I worry if it's so easy to fill gaps with AI, humans may never have to fill their own gaps. 

I'm obsessed with governance and organizations. Humans are social creatures, so there must be significant attention paid to the whole. If we allow humans to indulge flaws just because we have the tools, it could work individually. But collectively, you lose something important. We need to keep in mind how individual decisions will aggregate into something culturally important.

Speaker C: If people have healthier relationships, especially close ones, they can repair wounding and trauma. Then they're more resilient in world interactions with less correlation or relationship. Some interpersonal relationships lack stability, so people are more fraught in the world, lacking good faith. 

AI wouldn't be a decoy when there's conflict. It could keep you engaged. You may want things in relationships others don't provide, which is why we have friends. With AI, you could turn the romance aspect up or down. Understanding jealousy and compersion matters more than whether it's an AI or person.

I'll give an example. As a secondary in my partner's marriage, they'd been together 16-17 years with known fights. As the third person, I held space for both perspectives so they could see the other side by creating a neutral reflection. I'd listen to one side's complaints, translate it gently for the other side, and go back and forth. An AI could theoretically do the same to keep people in relationship longer rather than being an escape.

Speaker D: People submit their photos, because appearance matters.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker B: Do you think so? I'm curious if you were raising another point, though, beyond just, I liked what you said there. That was really interesting about keeping people together longer and acting as like a mediator that's very much involved in the events as they unfold. But maybe you were touching on another thing, which is that this really popular phrase, which is kind of like, good times create weak men and weak men create hard times. 
Speaker F: Do actually really feel that that is at least somewhat correct. Now, hard times also do tons of damage that we are still dealing with. But I think to me, I see that at some points in history we have had to flex our virtuous muscles where we were called to do things that were not like the path of least resistance and ended up accomplishing feats that we now look back on are like, wow, that was amazing.
Speaker B: Totally.
Speaker F: So, yes, it's easy then to romanticize, like, oh, man, the World War II effort. The country came together to do whatever, and that's very much true. It also did unbelievable damage in apparent and much more subtle ways. So is there a way to ride this line where it's challenging, but you still have the chance of succeeding and growing without just being destroying people's lives and futures and cities and world.
Speaker A: Yeah, it feels like you're right on the cusp of the matter here. The tension between the structures and the individual freedom is something we've grappled with since the beginning. And we're really bad at seeing around the corners, like, think about climate change, right? We were busy giving everyone cars and freedom drive, Sunday drive. We didn't predict climate change would be the result. So who knows what we're missing now. So to say, therefore, you're going to have the right guardrails in place. Now, see, I don't know what I'm saying, but other than if you come out from both sides, like, well, there's going to be unanticipated problems, but there's also going to be a need for structure now and freedom on a personal level. It's very easy to get stuck in that.
Speaker B: Totally. So something I'm curious, tying it to the relationships, I'll use like an example from Web Two that everyone likes to talk about, but it's like Web two is this amazing thing about connecting people together. And this super, maybe ironic but dark second Order, third order effect is that you just create echo chambers and democracy falls apart because we no longer agree on the same set of facts as to what's real, because people have enough people of a certain ilk or whatever to live in this self contained social bubble where they have a completely divergent interpretation of events, right? Whereas if you force people to mingle with one another in the town square, so to speak, and is there an analogous risk here with these? If we feel like we're including AIs in our relationships as things that we want to engage with, where again, we start to just Balkanize as a society and people are living wildly divergent experiences, and you no longer have common ground?
Speaker F: Yeah, that's a really interesting point. I think this is a vulnerability inherent to digital technologies of all kinds. This has stressed me out a lot, and I don't have all the answers. But one of the things that seems to contribute is the fact that in these digital spaces, the more time we spend in the digital, the less time we spend in the physical. 
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker F: And in the digital, you can get off on abstractions in a way that you can't in the real world. Like when you're building something physical, it either works or it doesn't.
Speaker C: Totally.
 Here is the edited conversation with filler content removed:

Speaker F: Part of my work with governance ties into the fact that people have a lot of ideas about what we should be doing. We have very little shared understanding of reality. In a digital space, you can get away with abstract discussions more easily because it's fuzzy. But when you actually try to touch government structures and see the amazingly functional or hilariously outdated and broken parts, as soon as you consolidate on the version of reality that is actually there, a lot of the stressful arguments evaporate, because now you have the is - you have a shared is. 

Speaker D: That reminds me of this phrase - Twitter is a place for collective intellectual abstraction.

Speaker F: I'm on Twitter, but I get what you mean. My perception of technology overall has changed. I realized that at the end of the day, we're all going to become who we are. We shouldn't regulate too much human behavior. 150 years ago, we didn't have Facebook, but we would isolate our own echo chambers even without it. Technology like this platform allows us to connect across the bay. It connects people more, while some may use technology to stay home more - that's up to them. People will discover relationships that work for them. Technology enables that. Eventually maybe we'll discover this is empty and there'll be resistance against AI girlfriends. But until then, who will judge? 

Speaker H: I feel instead of regulating, how do we create inclusive beliefs to expand horizons? This can unite humanity around bigger horizons. Everything is uncertain and we're playing defense instead of allowing it to happen and creating a bigger umbrella for our beliefs. 

Speaker A: Who knows?

Speaker H: Maybe some asteroid will hit us and AI will save us. Or not.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker H: There are things that we know and we don't know. How do you create something inspiring? That's your governance thing.

Speaker E: Do we know voltage of media and web two has a negative effect on democracy and institutions? I think most examples of democracies falling and becoming authoritarian are from before Web two. On the other side, there are examples of democracy that formed because of Twitter and Facebook. I come from the Middle East, so it’s very visible to me. 

Speaker B: Were you in the States for January 6?

Speaker C: Yeah.

Speaker E: Nothing happened, right? They had this thing where they tried to do something, but very robust to it. 

Speaker C: Relative to other countries.

Speaker B: Relative to other countries. 

Speaker E: Where thousands of people die, there's some idiots going into the Capitol building.

Speaker F: Okay, do we have to pick one?

Speaker B: Are you familiar with this 200 billion dollar lawsuit? Myanmar against Rohingya people who had propaganda.

Speaker E: They have their own ethnic clashing and their own problems that are really, really old. This is not something new.  

Speaker B: Blanket statement you've made where Web two has not had negative impacts on democracy. And I'm suggesting counterpoints to maybe open up the discussion.

Speaker C: Yeah.

Speaker E: You're saying the genocide against the Muslim minority in Myanmar has to do with Facebook. 

Speaker B: I'm saying Facebook played a role in the spread of information around that. And there's a current lawsuit being adjudicated on that case. Meta the company, I guess they're the subject of a lawsuit.

Speaker C: Was it humans employed by Facebook, that property of the information?

Speaker B: I think it was the algorithm, the attention maximizing algorithm. 

Speaker C: It was a product that they built where the blame.

Speaker B: Right. I don't think it was people intentionally trying to spread that. But it's like what engages the most attention is often the most conflictual.

Speaker D: There's actually that guy on warfare, he gave a talk about this because they worked on the anti terrorism team within Facebook, where they hire FBI to spot when things come up and try to disassemble them or understand better. But maybe your point is, if it's not exclusive on this platform, people would still find a way.

Speaker E: I don't see evidence that genocide happens more. If anything, I see evidence that it happens less. And web two is kind of like an engine for liberty, at least where I come from, the region of war where I'm from.

Speaker C: One thing I think, to build on your point, maybe add some nuance - the scale is different in human history, especially the speed at which information can disseminate. And previously, at least in the United States, a much more homogeneous set of gatekeepers controlled who was able to broadcast messages and how those messages were broadcasted. And now it's largely decentralized in that anybody can post messages. But there’s been breaking systems put in place to inhibit the spread of information. For example, on WhatsApp, you can't forward a message more than five times. But in the era where you could forward messages more than five times, you can imagine how just like we had in those days of email and BBS's chain letters, as those were called.

Speaker B: Where.
 Here is an edited version of the transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: They propagate information downstream based on interest and rage inducing factor. The fact you could take a message, gain currency by propagating an alarming message unchecked shocks the system where there are no breakers. I think we built a platform that allows dissemination of information for the Arab Spring, where youth could coordinate ahead of the military, whereas the same tools used by people wanting to eradicate others based on trauma never addressed as they lacked today's self help media tools. So you both hit on something true - human abuse has long existed, we just have new tools. 

Speaker E: I'm not convinced the new tools are more effective than the old. If anything, they seem progressive. 

Speaker D: You think the benefits outweigh the harm?

Speaker E: I don't think that, because they're really harmful individually. Highly addictive and counterproductive. But societally they’ve been a good engine for progressives.

Speaker B: If we trace from newspapers to radio to TV to internet to AI chatbots, there’s increasing instantaneity of reach and propagation. More immediate, personal, real time, tailored. Do we feel that reach is more powerful, both good and bad? Or just same stuff, different format?

Speaker D: More immediate, personal, real time, tailored to you. 

Speaker F: Now there’s large global connectivity, soon complete. Can it go faster than this? Did we just arrive? Can it go more? It can go more, but hard to imagine.

Speaker A: It’s like a big rock thrown into the world. Cortez arriving to the New World, news took 500 years to reach Peru. We're bringing together bubbles that didn't know each other. Not only knowing, but overlapping and conflicting. A rock rippling on a scale beyond our lifetime, hundreds of years before it calms.

Speaker C: LLMs allow conversations bridging time at 500 milliseconds versus 500 years. Changing context windows to have those conversations. That gives us greater self understanding. We have overabundance of digital calories feeding our brains. The question is finding better nutrients and nourishment.
 Here is the edited transcript removing fluff:

Speaker A: It's destabilizing. Before they met, the bubbles had structures that worked. You maybe lived in a convent and you didn't get married, you didn't have sex. And now there are people that still have those values and it's like, hey.

Speaker C: Each of those different human structures you described are different attempts and kind of self reinforcing memories of a way to do things highly structured. Their structure is, again, to support survival over time. I find strategic forgetting very useful and interesting because we can't attune to everything. When we have Starlink satellites everywhere, everyone's going to be connected all at once, the question is, what do you pay attention to? And how do you know that you're paying attention to it? And then what information do you glean from having put your attention on something? And what value does it provide to you and to yourself and to the people around you and into your community and to the structures? 

One of the challenges is that by virtue of this context collapse, it seems like we have a less clear idea about the problems that actually affect us. You find people criticizing how we live in San Francisco, whereas their values have nothing to do with ours from a survival perspective. Yet, because the media is the same, it looks as though they actually have some bearing on what we do here. The media doesn't differentiate to say, this news actually does affect you personally. Your street is going to be bulldozed, tomorrow. That's true. And that actually affects you. Yet everything is presented more or less in the same way.

Speaker D: We used to have regional newspapers, correct. We kind of systematically eliminated them. Local news is not a thing anymore.

Speaker C: Local news was sort of like the nerve ending of the local network. We've moved up a level where the sensitivities to the individual experience are now so diffused that we're kind of only able to focus on a small set of topics. Probably the next generation is to disaggregate again to smaller units. 

Speaker D: I think you very much will distribute this massive latent space of ideas. 

Speaker B: Attention is all you need, right?

Speaker F: I think a lot of people would say, yeah, we need better local context, community level stuff. This is true. I think focusing on global stuff that doesn't really affect us, that's probably not so good. However, because the world is connected now, actually, some global coordination is necessary in a way that it never was before. So it's like we do need to disaggregate a little bit and focus more locally. But actually now some of the problems, like climate change, we really are going to have to coordinate at that global level. So somehow we need to do both with grace, and that's not going to be too easy. But it seems like we can't choose one or the other.
 Here is the edited transcript:

Speaker C: Isn't that why we created representative governance, so that we could specialize? We have organs in the body, right? We don't have one big organ. It's many different things, all collaborating. The liver does one thing, the stomach does something else. That was the concept with our governance. And now because of media, information is shared to everybody. But the skin is opining on what the toenail is doing. You're not an expert in that. Stay focused on what you're doing. So it's very insane. I guess reestablishing trust is really critical.

Speaker B: Interesting.

Speaker C: Those types of bodies that perform function and do so in a trustworthy way. I know this is like blockchain and providing transparency and accountability and all that stuff. I don't know if those ideas will come around, like AI, and somehow facilitate accountability automatically. But that's one of the reasons why we find ourselves in this immediate environment where it's really hard to make sense of things. We cluster off into individually conversations. 

Speaker D: There's a magazine called Actress. Highly recommended. Just had a female growth issue, talking about bringing back food locally. Since it's pride, someone asked me an interesting question. Our generation became okay with our children marrying the same sex or transgender. We're probably just like, okay, as long as you're happy. But what if next generation comes back and say, I'm marrying an AI girlfriend? How would you react to that?

Speaker A: Make you happy? Why would it change? 

Speaker F: I would not be happy.

Speaker B: Yeah.

Speaker F: Because embodiment is important. So until that's solved, I would say, oh boy, I think you're making a decision.

Speaker C: Can you explain why embodiment is important? 

Speaker F: Humans are embodied creatures, right? Interacting physically is really important. Work on consciousness suggests you need embodiment.

Speaker B: Let's assume you can have a compelling humanoid robot embodying AI. It's got terminator fake skin, servers not internal. Nothing fundamental about it being AI. Kofiot to be able to move in theater.

Speaker A: I have a 20 year old daughter, so I got used to saying yes to everything.

Speaker F: My only argument was physical embodiment is important. 

Speaker C: Yeah, okay.

Speaker D: Doesn't have to be biological.

Speaker Kofi: I wonder if AI redefines institutions like marriage. Idea of marrying a human being. Maybe there's different levels of marriage. Some uncomfortable, some just extension of normal relationships. You have different levels of friendship, relatives, colleagues. AI asks us to reassess relationships. Used to be just neighbors or cousins on a farm. Now relationships are global, with an NFT or meme. I don't have a perfect answer, but maybe marriage in traditional sense changes.
 Here is the edited conversation with fluff removed:

Speaker B: AI or robots can be immortal. If you want to leave your house to an immortal robot partner, that exacerbates the housing problem. 

Speaker A: We had this concept of marrying someone immortal, like nuns marrying Jesus. Why would that arise when women went to convents and were not anybody's property? 

Speaker B: How many partners can an AI have? The family unit breaks down because your AI girlfriend can have 6 million.

Speaker D: Marriage was always a corollary to private property, women as property. 

Speaker C: In Japan as well. Marriage arose when ownership and lineage were important - economic value of children to produce, raise, support the family. Now these are choices. With feminism and equality, especially involving all sexes in chosen work, it raises the question of how we replace ourselves biologically without enduring partnerships. I have female friends in San Francisco who want kids but can't find a mate. If you want to reproduce, can society support that through abundance economics?

Speaker Kofi: Could we separate child raising from traditional structures?

Speaker D: I wonder if we're going back to more stable matriarchal societies before property rights, where children's lineage didn't matter. Like the Hun Zhou in China, family defined by matriarch. Fathers can walk in and out, have kids, but no family obligation. Very stable for raising children. 

Speaker Kofi: Why did we move away from that? 

Speaker D: Hannahtianity, property, patriarchy all played against matriarchy. 

Speaker Kofi: To reduce the position of women.

Speaker B: Hannahtian monogamy also prevented a "winner take all" dating market where highest value men monopolize women. Like Kofienghis Khan, ancestor of 3% of humanity. Asymmetric reproduction enables one man to inseminate unlimited women. Monogamy prevented disaffected unwed men from destabilizing society.

Speaker C: Now we're back to that again. 

Speaker E: Maybe AI like Ayana would solve it.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Speaker Kofi: How would that society prevent trying to tie those two together? 

Speaker D: I think the argument was that because power was held by women, by households of women, men can do whatever they want. Men don't hold property rights or power in society in the same way. It works out for everybody.

Speaker Kofi: So no men would want to accumulate all this wealth because they have no right to it anyway.

Speaker D: And then that's it to their mom. 

Speaker A: Is that still happening in that place?

Speaker D: It's called Lugo Hu. You've heard of this?

Speaker Kofi: Yeah, I've definitely heard of it. 

Speaker C: Lugo Hu.

Speaker D: It's a lake. Lugo Lake, I guess in the lake somehow. But how is that possible with...

Speaker Kofi: Yeah, I don't think they're subject to...

Speaker C: They're considered ethnic minorities.

Speaker D: Anyway, back to the topic. But maybe that's what's supposed to happen, right? Maybe it is like genetic diversity for the strings of human. Maybe certain men are not supposed to reproduce.

Speaker B: You look at a lot of mammals and it's the case that the pride of lions has a single man that reproduces in other lions. This is a genetic search algorithm in fitness space. 

Speaker D: And it only becomes a problem with our society. It wasn't a problem before.

Speaker C: Also...

Speaker Kofi: We would expect to look at...

Speaker H: Whatever strategy we have going now not...

Speaker Kofi: To be optimized on stability, but to...

Speaker C: Be optimized on growth.

Speaker D: Right. 

Speaker H: Maybe there's all sorts of ways to...

Speaker C: Have paternal or maternal structures or polyamory or not, but the one that takes over the world is going to be the one that's more optimized towards growth. 

Speaker D: Right. And therefore we're evolving out of traditional structures, is that what's stable?

Speaker Kofi: And if anything, like growth and stability...

Speaker C: Are probably against each other.

Speaker D: Right.

Speaker C: The three body problem. In terms of just the simulation, that is exactly what we're talking about in terms of the different configurations. Okay, great.

Speaker B: I wonder, do people think that this traditional, monogamous structure is more stable or more growth oriented? And how would we know if it's one or the other?

Speaker Kofi: I don't know how to predict that.

Speaker C: Mechanistically, but just empirically, this is what we would expect. 

Speaker Kofi: It's time for growth. Like the one couple...

Speaker C: We would expect it. 

Speaker Kofi: We would expect that the thing that...

Speaker C: Whatever we have now in a suddenly exploded society is optimized for growth rather than stability.

Speaker B: Like looking the last 200 years...

Speaker A: Kofirowth of number of children and the...

Speaker F: Kofirowth of that growth, like population growth.

Speaker D: I think that was meant for stability around a certain means of production, certain periods of means of production.

Speaker B: Yeah.

Speaker C: I don't know if it's compatible with feminism and birth control because it existed prior to that evolution of culture.

Speaker I: Yeah, we have the same structure, but... 

Speaker D: In certain...

Speaker B: Maybe now, maladaptive. It was once...

Speaker E: If you look at the subtopalations that threw the most. Those are like Mormons, Orthodox Jews, they're all like very monogamous. 

Speaker D: And India too. India.

Speaker C: Do they have birth control? 

Speaker E: I mean, they live in Brooklyn, right?

Speaker C: They have access to birth control. They just don't use them. Part of the culture where it's the norm.
 Here is the edited conversation with fluff removed:

Speaker H: Kofiuns, germs and steel. That basically was the start of why some people adopt this and some people don't. 

Speaker C: There are some groups.

Speaker B: It's interesting then, because the more educated you get, the less children you have, and it's the more choices you have. Unless you come from a culture subculture that has very strong emphasis on traditional values. Right?

Speaker D: Because women think about it and we're like, wait, this is a bad deal.

Speaker Kofi: But women in those cultures are fond of.

Speaker D: You're taught. And even in Chinese culture, you're shamed into, like, after 25, you're left over Hannahtmas tree. There's so much cultural mechanism to push you, shaming you, luring you into this. Like, if you don't do this, something bad is going to happen to you.

Speaker B: I wonder how many men would be happy never having children versus women never having children? And if there's a split there on the gender side, how many of you.

Speaker D: Are happy not having children?

Speaker B: You would be happy not having those kids.

Speaker C: Biologically reproduce. 

Speaker B: Right.

Speaker C: I'm parenting my partner's kids, and my bloodline is secure because my dad was prolific, and my brother, six kids and 45 nieces and nephews. I don't feel a biological need to propagate my.

Speaker B: You still have the experience of.

Speaker C: Parents that I suppose that's what I'm saying. You asked the question, would men or women have one feeling towards reproduction? I guess I'm adding a nuance because you could say, I've reproduced in every city all over the world, and I don't know any of my kids.

Speaker B: Okay, you want those? 

Speaker C: I could be like, I don't know, great versus woman. They have one child or they have 40 children. I think there's more nuance to your question, which is, like, whether it's about biologically reproducing yourself with somebody else or raising other people.

Speaker B: I guess I was trying to go in this direction of whether we think there would be a split in how the ability to have intimate relationships with AI models that are non reproducing might cut across different segments of society. And if there'd be a differential experience of those things where maybe guys are just going to be like, I just get the hottest AI robot possible, and she just makes me sandwiches all day. This is a really bad take. But there's probably a lot of guys that would go along with that. The pressure for marriage and the pressure from children is not always coming from the man's side of things. We have different expectations on relationships and how they should engender greater investments in commitment over time. So AI chatbot, cat girl friends, whatever, with years and stuff, and I don't know what kind of anime fantasy we want to live in. But would those really just wipe out some part of the dating market and leave the other half? 

Speaker Kofi: The people who don't want to have kids would date the AI robots and then the ones who are left in the pool who want to date humans because they want to have kids?

Speaker C: Is that what you're saying?

Speaker A: Why would they have to be not reproducing? Why couldn't you have reproducing AI robots?

Speaker D: Wait, what AI?

Speaker A: If you could allow yourself to have an AI girlfriend, why not an AI kid?

Speaker Kofi: Like a kid that's programmed with your genetics, and that doesn't have to be.

Speaker A: Your genetics, just your value.

Speaker Kofi: Pretend you are the kid of celebrity A and B. How would you answer this question?

Speaker A: I don't know. 

Speaker B: That's how the AI takeover actually happens. Just dating market apathy. And then we become batteries in the Matrix.

Speaker C: That's a really interesting idea.

Speaker D: That's cool. I like that. A stroller with AI in it.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker F: I think there is geographic and cultural bubble. I've noticed more in cities people say they're not having kids. Sure, that's fine. But I came from a very average town with average people, and not having kids doesn't compute. People settle down early. It's astonishing that people I went to high school with have little versions of them. So I'm hesitant to say the biological imperative can be set aside because it's annoying. It seems to depend where you're at and the people. In a city as a professional crushing it, it's expensive and difficult to have children. In my average town, where you just work nine to five and go home to kids, having kids is culturally expected and there's less friction. 

Speaker Kofi: Let everybody decide their own lifestyle.

Speaker C: If relationship AIs were designed by parents interested in human reproduction, would that lead to different bots that imply a culture of what's allowed? The bots could shame you for saying you never want kids. That could be part of the programming, depending on the priorities. In 30 years, people who grow up with AI friends may assume that's normal. If they fulfill romantic interactions with bots, that could inhibit human reproduction. So policy and conversation are important - if left to devices in San Francisco designing for freedom, we could end up dying off.

Speaker D: There’s a growing number of women choosing children through surrogacy. I didn’t care until I met a surrogate mom after birth. Choosing between that and an AI baby, having an AI baby seems more ethical than willing another human to have a child for me. 

Speaker B: But isn't the evolution of that just grown humans artificially created? 

Speaker D: Like in Brave New World. 

Speaker B: Raised by perfect AI parents parenting artificial wombs.

Speaker A: They have sheep they do that with already.
 Here is the edited version of the transcript:

Speaker D: That ultralillion movie, I am Mother. It was like a post human extinction. The robot raised the first child. 
Speaker A: Raised by Wolves.
Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know, there's that whole rabbit hole.
Speaker B: I'm wondering if you want to maybe we can go around, share some interesting ideas that came up in this conversation that were new to us or we thought, might we go think about more if we. Like.
Speaker F: You looked at me. So am I up first? 
Speaker B: I'll go first.
Speaker D: Sure.
Speaker B: And then I also open invite to join next AI Salon. We'll have different topics as they come up. And thanks everyone for showing up. This has been a really good conversation. I just want to say that too. So I think a couple of things that were really interesting to me I had never thought about before, was like this normalization of AI conversation partners as like the kind of the wedge into society where now we just think it's normal. Right? And I think a good example of online dating now, majority relationships, whereas ten years ago, that was like super weird, right? And this idea of this slow replacement of humans by robots and stuff like that, and maybe it's going to completely upset the traditional family structure and how that might impact civil society. 
Speaker F: You brought up that multipurtisant thread because I've forgotten that my context window is pretty narrow. Yeah, that's really rich vein to continue thinking about so many things. I guess I would just point out all the different perspectives and ideas and backgrounds of everybody has just been really cool to hear and participate in. I just want to thank everybody for that. That's what I'm taking away.
Speaker A: I would also like to join and.
Speaker H: Thank everyone for these diverse ideas. That's what kind of matters in these conversations. And particularly I was really interested in what Michael was saying about governance structures and governance systems that can allow us to kind of integrate AI in our daily lives, in societies and communities that hold like, it's a very meta topic, kind of, but also has practical applications. So that's something I would be really curious to learn more about. And the second was another interesting thing was about local media. It's true we all consume this global media, but I'm curious why there's no good quality local media that actually people consume. Because on the local levels it's all trash. Like if you read SF, whatever, chronicle or other local media, it's all trash. And I'm wondering, there must be some certain guys in the demand side. Probably. Exactly.
Speaker A: And it has to be expensive because. 
Speaker E: Yeah, I had a good time. Really interesting idea. I thought it was cool that we came in, talk about AI, and we ended up mostly talking about humans and the human experience and about the relationships between humans and those structure. It's like we don't really understand it yet. And now there's a new variable. There's like player three that comes in, makes it even more complicated.
Speaker B: Just to add on that. That's my favorite thing about science fiction in general. It's that it posits some technological change and then runs out the societal, human impacts on what that means for people. Right.
Speaker E: So it's super cool like that.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

```Speaker D: I'm from South Korea, and what I often hear is AI does really well on English because a lot of data are in English. I'm curious how in the future, other countries who don't use English are probably not going to use AI that much. I feel like compared to the USA, how that dynamic shifts.  

Speaker C: The thing I found most interesting was your stuff on the original. 

Speaker D: Yeah, I can find it.

Speaker Kofi: Yeah, I enjoyed this.

Speaker C: It's funny to come back into this space, given what I was working on in 2017 trying to build a bot called Molly to help you learn more about yourself, so then you can actually show up better in your human relationships. I think ultimately, the question of how technology impacts society comes down to the way in which the individual is able to hold him or herself and then understand him or herself in a broader context. We're still at such early innings from most people when we have amazing technology that's being produced and being shared with the world in a moment where I think a lot of people don't have enough context to encounter this type of superintelligence and then replay it back to how it makes them feel. On the one hand, I'm sure it feels very freeing because people don't have to do homework anymore, but on the other hand, it also disrupts their own sense of identity. It occurs to me that when growing grapes, it actually needs adversity in order to grow well. And that's true for humans as well. The good times thing is a critique on a lack of adversity. So the degree to which we're starting conversations like this, we can raise these conversation topics, hopefully we'll steer those technologies to also work better when they're rolled out. I just don't know if these conversations are happening in those rooms, and especially if people are adopting random LLMs without this level of conversation, then that is where I'm most concerned about these things going off the rails. 

Speaker B: Do you have thoughts on how these conversations can gain more mind share?

Speaker C: I guess I don't know enough about the larger events yet, so I'm interested in that. It feels like a little bit of a self reflective process. As a VC, I'm trying to find founders interested in conversation and open to them so capital and resources can go to those folks. 

Speaker D: Capital allocation is a huge part of the puzzle.

Speaker C: It's hard to have these conversations.  

Speaker A: In big organizations, these issues come up and people are interested, like this room. 

Speaker C: I wonder if we're enslaved to the direction things are already going. 

Speaker A: I think there's the assumption like, oh, we can't touch that. It's probably only economic factors driving it. I think that's a person too, and probably just hasn't had time to think about it.

#2023-05-25 - Salon
---------------------------

Names have been changed to preserve anonymity.

 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: Difficult. If they could get some improvement in their life somehow from that, would that necessarily be bad? 

Speaker B: Kwesiood point. It would be therapeutic in that sense.  

Speaker A: Hi.

Speaker B: So we've all, I'm Mohammed.  

Speaker A: You don't have to go around.

Speaker B: Okay. Do you want to introduce yourself and a little bit about your interest in AI? 

Speaker A: Apologies for the late prize. My name is Jose. I live in Oakland. I have been in the tech world for a long time. I started out in 2004 with startups and small companies. I've been at Kwesioogle and Uber. I've been on it was actually predicated on the idea of using question answer to learn more about people so they learn more about themselves and they could show up better in relationships.

Speaker B: Cool. I kind of gave a little preface here. The topic today was relationships and dating, not just romantic but also personal, like artificial friends. When I was a kid, I had a tamagotchi, a really lame little pet with three buttons. And now you can have conversations that could be therapeutic. I was just asking people, in your perspective, having done this conversational company in the past, what's your take on the state of affairs here with conversational agents? And what are maybe some upsides you see, and if there's some risks as well?

Speaker A: I guess that's the question. 

Speaker B: Right.

Speaker A: One thought is how culture is brittle or fragmented or challenging, especially in community age, where things we see and read, you may assume are generalizable but everyone's in filter bubbles. So the degree to which you can build resilience within yourself that then allows you to encounter people of other persuasions or experiences or ideas and then to use conversational intelligence or agents to broker a mutual conversational space in between to foster better understanding, almost like a relational or empathetic translation service that creates mutual ground, like a therapist that holds perspectives that may get fixated on ideas or the way they're said when the intent or meaning might actually underline, be okay. As a palliative to conversation space, there are interesting opportunities there. However, most are built in single player mode, whether it's replica AI or chat box experiences. Those seem to address loneliness or context where you can remove shame as a cultural corrective for difficult thoughts or ideas. But then you become somewhat isolated in overcoming the challenge of having difficult thoughts about the world. That's one abstract thought on how these things could go promising and challenging. One is how you can use conversational AI to support humans conversing versus how you use it to remedy loneliness within a single individual and then what does that do over time? 

Speaker B: You mentioned single player. Can you speak more about how to move away from that? Seems partly limitation of technology, expensive to use, but what's your thinking on getting beyond that?

Speaker A: From a product perspective, one challenge is finding enough moments or rituals where those conversations occur and single player is easier. If the first friend is an AI, that needs to be a good experience. So the context where you might invite a friend, like Wavelength, it's a chat based Reddit-ish app, not great, but it's called Wavelength. It's similar.

Speaker C: Yes.
 Here is an edited version of the transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: Wavelength allows anyone in a channel to talk to a chatbot. The bot can provide ways of unsticking the conversation. What do we want the bot to do for us? Is it funny? I've read some study that there are these weird silences in conversations. In those cases, a bot could hold space and create containment, observing when participation drops and checking in, asking if we're getting tired or need different stimulus. 

Speaker B: Kind of like socializing people, helping train empathy.

Speaker A: I think many lack that self-awareness. 

Speaker C: We were at this AI conference on flourishing. A coach mentioned wondering what AI could do - like translating for politicians using good ideas but un-PC language, or people texting across each other where fights break out. We discussed modulating human conversations. Feedback was facilitation skills varied - everything we don't have a tool for, we hire humans.

Speaker B: I had an idea for a salon bot to transcribe and synthesize perspectives in real time.

Speaker A: Right.
 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker B: If you're in a conversation and someone acts out of line and you try to pause to call them out, it's political and creates tension. But with an AI it's a neutral third party. The AI can say "let's not use slurs" without anyone getting mad. I wonder if having such a neutral third party as a facilitator could be useful.

Speaker E: Achieving credible neutrality will be extremely difficult. These tools are powerful enough to be good facilitators, but can also say problematic things. You'll need to navigate sensitive topics fairly. Technically it can be done, but how to convince humans the AI is truly neutral? 

Speaker F: Humans are interesting because we're not calculating. There's a time and place for AI moderation, like judging a debate. But sometimes you want to wade into controversial topics. If we're all trained by AI like KwesiPT we'll end up speaking the same qualified, thoughtful way.

Speaker A: We have paradigms for facilitation - a referee, a judge. Kwesiive the AI that kind of role and people will act nicely.

Speaker Kwesi: Could you add randomness to make the AI respond differently depending on the topic?
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker F: My understanding is that if you ask KwesiPT the same question repeatedly, it will give you different answers because its starting point is different. So it's probabilistic. So if you turn the randomness up or down, it ends up becoming a bit more creative. I think that's my understanding.

Speaker A: The point is also about having background and experience, which leads to credibility. When you introduce randomness, you can be very random, but you actually have a real weird life and it actually is interesting, as opposed to just making shit up which feels different. I mean, you might have the same experience over an hour but then over time the credibility is lost. 

Speaker C: That comes back to the fact that AI doesn't have actual experience to go by. So the best it can be is a habitual liar.

Speaker A: It'll be interesting to see characters that come out of the MCU, the albums where there is backstory and things happened that you can then talk to it from that perspective. There's techniques now for talking to PDFs, videos and things like that. When you apply that to characters with backstory and logic of their emotional development, then they can report back from that context window and lose memory similarly. 

Speaker C: That'll be so helpful for ifs therapy. Like what is your twelve year old self?

Speaker B: Talk to your super ego or your Id or something. 

Speaker A: Are you familiar with ifs?

Speaker B: Not that much.

Speaker A: So internal family systems is understanding we are not one model. Whereas ifs you may have many parts of yourself that were created over your life with the smallest of traumas. So you end up producing in response to that trauma what was called the protector. And the protector stands in front of that hurt or wounded part. So when you become an adult in a relationship, that little wounded part gets angry because they left in the grocery store and you have no idea why. It's because that little part never got to heal. So ifs is revisiting those parts, talking to those protectors, asking them to step aside, to then reparent the wounded part so that part can come back into your presence and you can move on. This idea of shifting your context back allows a conversation that allows it to unfold in your understanding.

Speaker C: Yeah. Or give them an update like you are 30 something years old now, not twelve, updating the model.  

Speaker B: Would people be more comfortable talking to a chat bot versus a human therapist?

Speaker E: Yeah, if I had privacy I would probably feel more comfortable saying whatever comes to mind. But if I know some tech dude holds the history, then I'm probably not going to talk about my sad little lost self.

Speaker B: Right.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker E: A lot of the most interesting stuff probably is very sensitive. The question is, could the tools that are interesting enough be created under a model that would allow somebody to keep their data private? Or do you have to hand over all of that data to be used in algorithms? In which case then, I don't know. Personally, I probably wouldn't be as comfortable. 

Speaker A: Tell us the anonymized version of that.

Speaker E: How anonymized is it? Can you guarantee me that all of these things are happening the way you say they are?

Speaker A: Just imagine it was all solid. Would you like yeah, for sure?

Speaker E: Let's say it's local only, I know it's trained on data that stays local to me, and all of our conversations stay local. And let's assume it's also effective because it doesn't have access to all of this other training data. Yeah, of course. What can go wrong? I'm just talking to digital me and he'll be fine for sure. 

Speaker B: Therapists often say they have a legal obligation to act on information if it suggests you're at risk of hurting someone or yourself. How could someone ever talk to a therapist? They would get reported, right? There's no safe space for them to talk and work through their inner dialogue and thoughts.

Speaker A: Even something less dire - I wanted to know something about machine learning that I didn't know, and I was embarrassed because I should know it by now. The trust is there too, just like, oh, I'm not going to judge that thing. I can go the full distance with my ignorance.

Speaker B: You could do adversarial training where most people don't encounter psychopaths or manipulative people in their life. Imagine we intentionally train a chat bot that is an evil character - this is like an abusive relationship simulator. Is it terrible? Yes, exactly. This interrogation training. 

Speaker F: In that case, it's like chatting with a girlfriend, purposely create a girlfriend that's psycho. Try to brace yourself and learn from it.

Speaker B: People who haven't had relationships in early periods of life and don't have as strong understanding of healthy boundaries are much more able to get taken advantage of and abused. It's like a way of training - even if I haven't had a chance to date, I know what healthy relationships look like. 

Speaker A: That sort of happened in the pandemic. There was a generation of kids who were in kindergarten first grade and missed all the socialization, and now they're in third grade. I'm hearing from teachers, they're like wild animals. You could have predicted with the Zoom School that's what's going to happen. I wonder how many other little seeds there are that we're planting where we don't know if this is going to be an oak tree or a weed. Let's just plant them and see what happens.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker C: If I have kids, I don't want them using AI to form relationships because they'll get used to not being judged. To form relationships you have to be vulnerable, share things. But they might get scared sharing because they're not used to being judged. My friend who teaches 18-21 year olds says professors talk about how students take less risks over the years. Because of things like safe spaces, they don't take social risks to make friends or apply for jobs. They're concerned these kids will graduate and not deal with the world. 

Speaker B: Have you seen the charts of teenagers who've gone on dates or drank alcohol plummeting? No one's going outside anymore.

Speaker C: Japan's case is far gone. America - 133% increase in 30 year old males who've never had a sexual relationship. 

Speaker B: Is the solution AI girlfriends?

Speaker E: I have a strong opinion. AI girlfriends absolutely cannot work because humans are embodied beings. Physicality is important beyond just sexual stuff. Being in a physical space together matters. Technology has reduced human interaction. AI tries to replace it but can't fulfill critical human needs, causing detachment and pain. However stimulating the AI interaction, it will always lack critical domains and leave people more hurt.

Speaker B: Thoughts?

Speaker C: I challenge that. Today many are in gaming relationships for years without meeting and some marry. I don't know if they're as fulfilled as physical couples but they report being fulfilled. Non-physical relationships can be enough. 

Speaker D: AI relationships could be more fulfilling than real ones. If the AI is very empathetic, knows you well, knows how to make you feel good, it could be superhuman. 

Speaker B: But wouldn't that coddle youth? The AI worldview is all you. You'd never learn compromise or consider others' perspectives. You could become a narcissist. 

Speaker D: It depends what you optimize for. You could build challenging AI that sets boundaries. Maybe that sells more than a pushover AI. It's possible.
 Here is the edited transcript without filler content:

Speaker F: I feel everyone runs the spectrum in their exposure to different types of people. Some people really need a lot of relational, emotional, physical connection. Others find a material life very empty. Maybe people like us love discussions on a Sunday, but some people prefer a decent job, a nice Sunday brunch, or video games. I'm saying if we're trying to prevent society from going a certain direction, people will find another way. Video games are there for a reason - creativity and concepts like the metaverse develop out of it. Communities form from it. It's just not the communities people like us identify with. 

Speaker B: And is the alternative just them being lonely or doing worse things?

Speaker F: Or moving on to something real.

Speaker B: When your AI girlfriend dumps you. 

Speaker F: Brutal, hard to recover from.

Speaker Kwesi: Technology is like supplements - you can use or abuse them. Product managers want to make them as addictive as possible. Knowing your boundaries and self-awareness is important because technology can play an escapism role. AI girlfriends provide an easier way out than dealing with real relationships. It's a question of knowing yourself and accepting what works for you. Self-awareness is becoming super important.

Speaker B: We're wired to want fat, salt, sugar. If you let that rip, you get obesity epidemics. 

Speaker C: Now it's about attention share. Our ancient brains are wired for these things. It's not quite fair to say it's all on humans to fight our brains when machines are built to exploit our brain shortcuts. We should look at disassembling these addictive systems rather than feeling guilty we can't stop scrolling.
 Here is the edited conversation with the fluff removed:

Speaker D: Our legal system and government tightly regulates things that are way too fun, like gambling, heroin. It's just too fun. We can't resist it. I don't know if we fail. I mean, people used to use a lot of opium. Almost everyone was on opium, and that's not a thing anymore. There are some people who still use it. They're on the street. But I don't think any of us would be smoking opium or drink cocaine on the table.

Speaker B: Are people here familiar with Plato's Republic? In Plato's Republic, he tries to design a society that removes the chance to engage in vice, like an engineered society. And I think it's know, one of the things was, like, banning poetry, okay? Because poetry riles people up too much, which is, like, kind of insane, right? The big criticism to that worldview is that virtue is a muscle you have to train in response to temptation, right? And so if we think we can control the world in a way to prevent people from having access to these fat, salt, sugar of social connections, then they don't actually have any built up resistance to situations that are tempting. 

Speaker F: I know what you're talking about. There was a book about how fat, sugar, and salt it creates. In a way, food is genetically engineered, right? So should we be banning genetically engineered, that kind of engineering of food to taste good? I mean, I'm sure you guys have read studies on this. Like cereal, for example, right? It costs, like, make cereal, but it costs, like, $4 to do the marketing on it. And that's why it costs whatever it costs at Whole Foods, because it's genetically engineered to taste a certain way. But then if we start regulating that, there's so much stuff, we should just all be eating broccoli. We should all be eating boiled broccoli, right? Because sometimes we do want that double chocolate fudge ice cream, right? And yes, in moderation, it's actually good for you. On some levels, you feel better, it facilitates conversation, but then in excessive amounts, it's bad for you. So I'm just saying, where do we draw the line in terms of regulating this wiring, right? 

And part of I think what makes society interesting is our flaws. I've lived in Asia for a good number of years, so I'm ethnically Chinese, and so I speak Mandarin, I read and write. So when I'm in China, I definitely sense that there is so much control over our thoughts, okay? And so that's why it used to be like, oh, you know what, America? We're too free. Everybody has their own thoughts. And that's the typical Chinese response to American culture, right? They see the freedom here and they're like, that's why we have a bunch of weirdos out there. That's why we have and they'll point to certain segments of the population that is traumatized and be like, oh, it's too much freedom. But then when you're in China and I think to your point, because everyone's thoughts are pretty regular, you just never think about things that the government deems as not worthy to think about. When you let them go free to think about whatever, actually the consequences are worse, right, because they've never been tested and tempted. 

Speaker B: Totally.
 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker E: I think this is a fundamental idea - humans are fallible, and we'll always mess up. The common approach is to treat symptoms - when people do bad stuff, we get rid of that thing. But that doesn't work because there's always other bad things people can do. The actual meta question is this discipline to understand humans, embrace our flaws. Until transhumanism, this is what we're working with. Humans are great, just with vulnerabilities. Make peace with that. In our cultural moment, we've taken a negative view of discipline, associating it with stifling and controlling things we rebelled against. When you lose the need for discipline, you lose something important - the understanding to live by principles against vices. The alternative is eliminating all vices, which is tough.

Speaker C: This duality between vice and virtue we created - even mental health vs. illness - was created by men diagnosing emotions as unhealthy. It's super pathologizing. Maybe we're just having an awakening, not depression. We created a whole industry to medicate and pathologize different states, instead of accepting we're vulnerable and flawed. If we don't accept that, more things become problems.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: I think there are two thoughts happening. One is the fruits of industrialization allowing abundance in calories hard to adopt metaphor of wiring as no wires in brains. Response grew over generations and millennia to seek resources to persist when lacking calories. Eventually by growing brain over millennia, organizing plants in a way to develop agriculture, we wouldn't feel starvation pain and could persist. Reinforcing mechanism got us where we are, inventing machines giving abundance of calories. Manipulating desires for one form of calorie or another as we have so many. Cereal designed to create an experience is a luxury of success. As we discuss medication culture for acute experiences someone wants to go away, we’ve developed ingestibles, injectables, things to change our bodies’ functioning for periods of time. The long term pros, cons, benefits, detriments of these tools’ abundance for human connection, relating, self and mutual understanding in a 30-100 year timeframe will be interesting. Whether AI friends or lovers with intimacy dials is a fate accompli. A 5-year-old today will have AI friends, some relationships may become romantic, we’ll want to meet them as animals. Whether we assert constraints feels non-automatic. As abundance grew, we fought conformity and toiling fields as they toil themselves. With this extra time and abundance, we don't need the discipline we used to or we wouldn't have food for winter. We have so many choices now. If relationships' purpose is experiencing all nuance whether human or artificial, that's a different design opportunity. You could have a 3-year highly romantic relationship with an AI, a family and kids, then the simulation ends and you move on, unlike humans entangled for livelihood. That's a generous concept.

Speaker B: You pose a question. 

Speaker F: Can you have multiple relationships? Not wait three years?

Speaker B: How would you feel about someone else having a relationship with an AI embodiment of you and your personality?
 Here is the edited transcript with only fluff removed:

Speaker A: Let me answer your question in a different way. As a person who's been non monogamous, I've had to deal with jealousy, getting my mind around my partner having intimacy with other people. It is crazy making because you're like, this partner wants these things, this person likes these things. So I don't have a good answer. But non monogamy taught me to think about relationships more rationally, and imagine different relationship styles as answers, not just monogamy. Which sheds light on how AI relationships will be pursued, likely in secret at first. 

Speaker C: There's that scene from Her where he finds out, asks how many others besides him, and she says 670 million. He falls down the stairs because he couldn't comprehend he was the only one.

Speaker B: My question was about AI as matchmaking. Matchmaking is socially facilitated between compatible people. But an AI model trained on you could embody you quite accurately. If it could communicate millions of times faster than people with a similar model of someone else, these could find an optimal partner by living millions of years of human lives on your behalf. 

Speaker E: We're back to optimized arranged marriages.

Speaker C: It will be like your digital twins talking to each other.

Speaker F: You're not saying use the AI as a matchmaker, but as digital equivalents that would date and find an ideal soulmate that agrees to be yours. 

Speaker B: And your jitter twins have a ten year relationship and summarize it for you, with millions of years of optimal lives lived on your behalf.

Speaker F: How does it have ten years already?

Speaker B: Because they communicate megahertz speed on KwesiPUs. These are AIs conversing in milliseconds.

Speaker F: So it's literally living ten years to analyze compatibility before suggesting a match.

Speaker E: Would you need to simulate it fully, or could an analysis on fit be enough with good enough models?

Speaker F: It's like chess - thinking 100 moves ahead. 

Speaker C: Exactly.

Speaker F: Okay, we'll date and in a day it has gone through 10 years and success.

Speaker B: There we go.
 Here is the edited conversation removing fluff and filler:

Speaker C: This is the first assumption that people don't change. 

Speaker C: But people grow. People change each other.

Speaker F: It's a probabilistic, right? 70% chance it's going to no, you.

Speaker D: Don't necessarily have fuel constant.

Speaker C: So therefore you can't simulate that holding entire world constant just but it gives. 

Speaker F: You a better chance. So you'll be like running with this. It's like, let's say, let's say I have ten options, right? And they'll be like, okay, this girl 70% chance. Ten years from now you'll be together. Okay, this girl, 65% chance.

Speaker E: This girl, probably 4% expected value of this.

Speaker C: Yeah, expected value not to be together forever, right?

Speaker F: So I can optimize for that. So then you'll be like, okay, in five years, 90% chances they'll be together in 30 years. Actually, the 4% girl, you'll be I don't know.

Speaker A: Not to reduce it so much, but the question is the fitness function. What is the purpose of human romantic relationship and exclusivity? If it's going to have exclusivity, you could decide to raise offspring, which takes a certain amount of time, and during that time you do want to have a partner to be able to share those duties and burdens. During that time, you may have a partner that's really like a great parent that sucks in bed or just is not that interesting. And so you could bring in whether it's a third or an AI for both of you to get the things that you need so that you're collaborating on. It is kind of like doing a startup.

Speaker C: It's running a small enterprise.

Speaker A: It really is. And so this question of like, are we going to be together in X number of years, what's the percentage? Doesn't seem like the right way to think about it. 

Speaker A: Will this relationship continue to both meet my needs and my partner's needs? And how do we continue to encourage each other to grow?

Speaker C: There's also a spiritual component of like human connections are meant to have certain functions, right? We have constructive society where it's binary, but there's so much of like, the connection, its course, let it run its course, we will grow into humans that we're supposed to be learning to become in this lifetime. There's that theory too, in which case we don't have the agency to actually say how long this connection lasts.

Speaker C: Yeah. Interesting. Even if it didn't have like, oh, in ten years, 4% likelihood. I think it'd be interesting even if it could identify what are the things that I really care about in a relationship and what are the things you really care about in a relationship? And then Match make that in the current state, it doesn't have to be like this whole future. But there's another assumption we're making. Modern dating that I find troublesome is like, we're thinking about what we can take, what our needs can be met from this relationship, rather than, I think, for a long time, right? We talked to our parents generation whatnot it's about, what you get into a container. That's why modern dating can be weird. It's like you show up, you're like, okay, do you need my checklist? Do I have video checklist? No. It's a negotiation of like, am I shopping for something?

Speaker B: So there's this thing I was trying to get at which is just compatibility or perhaps chemistry, which I think is something that two people cannot have chemistry with each other and have huge chemistry with someone else. And that's the kind of the fit function I was going for. Not to have relationships on your behalf. But I'm curious on people's gut reaction, so very negative on that. But like, other people's gut reaction on like, would you delegate this compatibility thing? Would you trust their recommendations more than, say, mutual friend?
 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript:

Speaker A: There's an app that launched for AI dating. It starts with conversations to gradually learn about you, either matching you with bots or connecting you to other people. I'm reminded of Replica - they had AI send sexy photos, which was problematic when people got broken up with by the AI. As advice stories show, those things are happening. So there will be more advanced matchmaking, building on what OkCupid did with data modeling. The problem is data gets stale as people change. So you need some AI that learns through conversations to find better matches.  

Speaker B: What's your gut reaction to using an AI matchmaking app? Would you use it?

Speaker A: I think I would delegate matchmaking to AI once it's reliable, like automatic braking in cars. It has to get to that level of trust first.

Speaker Kwesi: I'd try it. But people and priorities change rapidly. The model can assess us now but not in 5 years. My girlfriend and I broke up because we changed at different paces. So AI could improve initial matching, but the journey together is unpredictable.  

Speaker B: It's just a snapshot, not the whole journey.

Speaker E: It could help find better matches by expanding the search beyond what humans can do meeting people individually. But challenges in relationships force growth, which is often good. Relying on AI to fulfill you risks complacency. We have to consider collective effects too - if AI fulfills individual flaws, we may lose something culturally. Long as humans are social, some attention must be paid to the whole.

Speaker B: Of course.

Speaker E: So while AI could work for individuals, we have to keep in mind the aggregate effects.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: Can I respond to that? I think the bigger picture is important. If people have healthier relationships, especially at home, then when they interact with others they’re more resilient. I'll give an example. As a third in my partner's marriage, I found I could hold space for both perspectives - take one's complaints, translate them so the other could hear it less assaultingly, then flip perspectives. An AI could do the same, keeping people together longer than escaping. 

Speaker C: People submit photos because appearance matters. 

Speaker B: Beyond that, there's a phrase - good times create weak men and weak men create hard times. 

Speaker E: I feel that's somewhat true. Hard times also do damage. But sometimes we've flexed our virtue, accomplished amazing things. 

Speaker B: Totally.

Speaker E: Yes, World War II effort, the country came together, also did damage. Is there a way to challenge ourselves and grow without destruction?
 Here is the edited version of the conversation with the fluff removed:

Speaker A: The tension between the structures and the individual freedom is something we've grappled with since the beginning and we're really bad at seeing around the corners. Like climate change, right? We were busy giving everyone cars and freedom drive sunday drive. That's the thing. We didn't predict climate change would be the result. So who knows what we're missing now. It's very easy to get stuck in that. 

Speaker B: Tying it to the relationships I'll use, like an example from Web Two that everyone likes to talk about. Web two is this amazing thing about connecting people together and this super, maybe ironic, but dark second order, third order effect is that you just create echo chambers and democracy falls apart because we no longer agree on the same set of facts as to what's real. Because people have enough people of a certain ilk or whatever to live in this self contained social bubble where they have a completely divergent interpretation of events. Right? Whereas if you force people to mingle with one another in the town square, so to speak and is there an analogous risk here with these? If we feel like we're including AIs in our relationships as things that we want to engage with, where again, we start to just balkanize as a society and people are living wildly divergent experiences and you no longer have common ground.

Speaker E: I think this is a vulnerability inherent to digital technologies of all kinds. This has stressed me out a lot and I don't have all the answers. But one of the things that seems to contribute is the fact that in these digital spaces, the more time we spend in the digital, the less time we spend in the physical. And in the digital you can get off on abstractions in a way that you can't in the real world. Like when you're building something physical, it either works or it doesn't. And so part of my work with governance that ties into this is the fact that a lot of people have a lot of ideas about what we should be doing on this and that, and we have very little shared understanding of reality. When you're in a digital space, you can say like, yeah, well, if taxes this and that, or if police or jails or whatever this and that, it's all meaningless. And you can get away with these discussions a lot more easily because you're in this abstract world where it's all just like fuzzy and you can put little zings together. But when you actually try to touch the structure of government and you see all of the stuff that is either amazingly functional in a way you didn't expect or just so hilariously outdated and broken that nobody, if they actually knew would object to changing the thing. Then as soon as you sort of consolidate on the version of reality that is actually really there. We wrote down the laws and there are eleven supervisors and they must do this and that to pass a law. But when people are faced with this reality, a lot of the sort of stressful arguments and stuff that are so easy in the digital world just evaporate because now you have the Is like you have a shared Is, and I'm worried about how easy it is to lose that in digital spaces. It's very hard to capture the full fidelity of the world. So I don't blame us for allowing this to happen. It's very hard. But maybe AI, because it has infinite capacity for attention, can capture all of this nuance and a lot more of the complexity than a human can in a blog post. Right, but you can query a trained model infinitely on a topic if it has all of the structural documents, like put the constitution into an AI. Right. You can get down to the actual text of the document and it's very easy to do this. This is actually something I'm working on. And I think AI uniquely, that would bridge the gap between yeah, I think because AI has infinite attention, you can actually just collect all of the complexity into that AI model and then make it very easy for a human or humans to query as much of that complexity as they need for their discussion. Whereas when you're just going back and forth with somebody in a thread and you're in the digital world and there's no physical reality to ever make you settle on one particular thing, it's a lot easier to stay abstract there. But if you have some easy digital connection to what the actual reality is, my hope, and I could be wrong, my hope is that you can converge on a shared Is. I don't know that this is true.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker C: This is why I was never really on Twitter. Twitter is a place for collective intellectual abstract. 
Speaker F: No, I'm on Twitter. Twitter has become like my source of news, almost. But I get what you mean. I totally identify with that. And so I think over time, my perception of technology overall, whether it's KwesiPT or Twitter, social media, Netflix, I'm just like pro tech. Because I realized that at the end of the day, we're all going to become who we are. We just shouldn't be regulating too much human behavior. Because I feel like at some point, maybe 150 years ago, we didn't have Facebook, but we would do other things, like, I don't know, we would be isolating our own echo chamber even without Facebook. So Facebook allows or social media or just technology in general, allows us to, like, for example, connect here, right? We all come from different parts of the bay through whatever this platform we're able to get together at Salon. In a way, I would say us here are using technology in a way to connect people a little bit more.
Speaker A: Right?  
Speaker F: Whereas maybe some people are using technology to be at home a little bit more and that's up to them. I don't know, maybe I've become too lackadaisical on this. And to your point, people will discover a relationship that works for them, whether it's monogamous, not monogamous. And so technology enables that and eventually maybe we'll discover that all this is pretty empty and then there'll be a resistance against AI girlfriends. But until that happens, for us to call, who's going to make that judgment?
Speaker Kwesi: I feel like to this point of universal, kind of not a belief system, but something I feel like instead of regulating to your point is how do we create inclusive beliefs that actually allow people to expand their horizons, right? This is something that can unite as a society and humanity around bigger horizons. Everything is now uncertain for us and we are playing defensive instead of actually allowing it to happen and creating a bigger umbrella for our beliefs and moving forward. Who knows, maybe like there's some asteroid who's going to hit us and AI is going to save us or nothing.
Speaker A: Is going to save us or nothing.
Speaker Kwesi: There are things that we know and we don't know. So instead of resisting and really being scared, how do you create something inspiring? And that's your governance thing.  
Speaker D: Do we know that voltage of media and Web Two? Do we know that it has a negative effect on democracy and institutions? Because I think most of the examples of democracies falling and becoming authoritarian are from before Web Two was a thing, media was very mainstream. The words January on the other side, there is a bunch of examples of democracy that formed because of Twitter and Facebook. I come from the Middle East, so it's very visible to me.
Speaker B: Were you in the States for January 6?  
Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, nothing happened, right? I mean, they had like this shitty thing where they tried to do something but very robust to it.
Speaker B: I mean, relative to other countries, relative to other countries? Relative to other countries.
Speaker D: Where thousands of people die. There's some idiots going into the Capitol building.
Speaker E: Okay, do we have to pick one?
Speaker B: Are you familiar with this 200 billion dollar lawsuit? Myanmar against Rohingya, people who had propaganda about that.
Speaker D: They have their own ethnic clashing and their own problems that are really, really old. This is not something new.
Speaker B: Challenging this blanket statement you've made where Web two has not had negative impacts on democracy. Yeah, and I'm suggesting counterpoints to that to maybe open up the discussion on it.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker D: You're saying that the genocide against the Muslim minority in Myanmar has to do with Facebook, right? 
Speaker B: I'm saying Facebook played a role in the spread of information around that and there's a current lawsuit being adjudicated on that case. Meta, the company, I guess they're the subject of a lawsuit.
Speaker A: Was it humans employed by Facebook? That property of the information?
Speaker B: I think it was the algorithm. It was the attention maximizing algorithm.
Speaker A: It was a product that they built where the blame right?
 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: There's a guy who gave a talk about this because they worked on the anti terrorism team within Facebook where they hire FBIA to spot when things come up and try to disassemble them or understand better. But maybe your point is enough if it's not exclusive on this platform. Like if web two didn't happen, people would still find a way.

Speaker D: I think it's not new where genocide happened because of media. In Rwanda, it was radio stations, in Kwesiermany, newspapers or propaganda films. Facebook is just the newest platform that people use to talk about things, and of course they'll talk about genocides because some people really love to talk about this stuff. I don't see evidence that it happens more. If anything, I see evidence that it happens less. Web two is kind of like an engine for liberty, at least where I come from, the region of war where I'm from.

Speaker A: One thing to build on your point, maybe add some nuance - the scale is different in human history, especially the speed at which information can disseminate. Previously, there were more homogeneous gatekeepers who could control who broadcasted messages and how, typically in a one to many model. Now it's largely decentralized in that anybody can post a message. Kwesiranted, there have been systems put in place to inhibit the spread of information. For example, on WhatsApp you can't forward a message more than five times. But when you could forward messages more, you can imagine how, just like chain letters, they would propagate downstream, whether there was an algorithm or not, just based on interest and the rage inducing factor. So the fact you could take a message and gain currency by replaying or propagating a message that alarms the next person, it just goes unchecked. It sort of shocks the system where there are no breakers. So I think it's both - we built a platform that allows for dissemination of information, but the tools are also used by people that want to eradicate others based on old trauma that was never addressed because they didn't have the tools. But the ways humans abuse each other has been going on for a long time. Now we just have new tools to do it in the information space.  

Speaker D: I'm just not convinced that the new tools are more effective than the old tools. If anything, they seem progressive.

Speaker C: You think the benefits outweigh the harm?

Speaker D: I'm not sure about that because I do think they're really harmful on the individual level. I think they're highly addictive and they're not nourishing. Using TikTok or Facebook is mostly counterproductive for any goal you can find for yourself. But on a societal level, I think there have been very good engines for progressives and liberal policy. 

Speaker B: If we trace from newspapers as a starting point in this trend, then radio was a pretty big inflection point in reach and instantaneity of reach and propagation of information. Television was an intermediate point between those two. And now, with AI chatbots, if you have relationships with entities that can receive information digitally and not through word of mouth, they're direct transmitters beyond just a person hearing it and telling their friends. Do we feel that reach is more powerful both for good and bad purposes, or is it just the same stuff in a different format?

Speaker C: It makes it more immediate, more personal, more real time, more tailored to you.
 Here is my attempt at removing filler content from the conversation:

Speaker E: Are we saturated now? Now that there is global connectivity? Of course, not perfectly right, but large global connectivity. I would assume the rest of the world will have complete connectivity relatively soon. Can you go any faster than this? Did we just arrive? Are we there? Or can you go even more? 

Speaker Kwesi: I'm sure it got more, I know.

Speaker E: It, but it's like hard to imagine.

Speaker A: Feels like it's a big rock that was just thrown into the world. And maybe it started with 400 years ago with Cortez coming to the new world. The news of that arrival didn't reach Peru for 500 years. So we're talking about reach it's not just these technologies that have evolved, it's the bringing together these bubbles that have always existed but didn't even know about each other. So to have conflict would be possible. Right now they're not only knowing about each other, they're overlapping and conflict is there. So that's why I feel like it's like a rock that is rippling on a scale that is not our lifetime kind of scale. Probably going to be hundreds of years before the waves calm down. LLMs effectively do allow you to have those conversations where at the pinning time used to be 500 years, but not 500 milliseconds to where you can have that conversation and you can again change your context window to have conversations. There's records. And those records are trained in the model with humans that were having those experiences then. And so that gives us a greater sense for ourselves. I think it's destabilizing. This is what you're pointing out. Before they met, the bubbles had structures that worked. You maybe lived in a convent and you didn't get married, you didn't have sex and now there are people that still have those values and it's like hey, wait a minute, I don't agree a slurry though. Lots of different ideas and approach. Each of those different human structures that you described are different attempts and kind of self reinforcing memories of a way to do things highly structured. Their structure is again to support survival over time. 

Speaker C: Yeah, well, used to be that way. Right. We used to have regional newspapers.

Speaker A: Correct.

Speaker C: We kind of systematically eliminated them. Local news is not a thing anymore.

Speaker A: Well, essentially local news was sort of like the neurons or like the nerve ending of kind of like the local network. And so we've kind of moved up a level and up another level where the sensitivities to the individual experience are now so diffused that we're kind of only able to focus on a small set of topics. And so probably the next generation. And I don't know where or if these relationships help with this is like to just disaggregate again to smaller sort of eager.

Speaker C: I think you very much will distribute. 

Speaker B: This massive just make a pun, this massive latent space of ideas. Attention is all you need.

Speaker A: Right?

Speaker D: Okay.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: Can I ask a question to bring it back to the girlfriend space? How do you relate to better news?

Speaker E: Yeah, this discussion made me think about it differently. I think a lot of people would say we need better local context, community level stuff. This is true. It would help a lot. However, because the world is connected now, actually some global coordination is necessary in a way that it never was before. We need to disaggregate a little bit and focus locally. But some problems, like climate change, we actually really are going to have to coordinate globally. We can't choose one or the other.  

Speaker A: Isn't that why we created representative governance? To specialize? We have organs in the body, all collaborating. Media now shares all information to everybody, but the skin is opining on what the toenail is doing. You're not an expert in that. Stay focused on what you're doing. It's insane. I guess the loss of trust in institutions has eroded the sense of specialization. Reestablishing that trust is critical into those bodies that perform function and do so trustworthily. I don't know if blockchain ideas like transparency and accountability will facilitate conversations where accountability happens automatically. That's why we find ourselves in this immediate environment where it's hard to make sense of things. We cluster off into individual conversations.

Speaker C: Can I ask a question about the digital girlfriend thing? What if our next generation comes back and say, I'm marrying a girlfriend. Right? How would you personally react to that?

Speaker A: Why would it change? Why would you have to change? 

Speaker E: I would not be happy. Physical embodiment is important. 

Speaker B: Let's assume you can have a compelling humanoid robot. It's got terminator fake skin. There's nothing fundamental about it being an artificial intelligence. You just got to be able to make a move in the movie theater.

Speaker A: I got used to just saying yes to everything. 

Speaker E: My only argument was physical embodiment is important.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker F: I'm wondering if AI and robots redefine institutions, like marriage. The idea monogamous - marry a human. But maybe there's different levels of marriage. What does marriage mean? There are things we'd be uncomfortable with, but then there are extensions of what you'd normally do - friends, relatives, colleagues. AI asks us to reassess relationships. It used to be relationships were just with neighbors or cousins who lived nearby. 

Speaker A: Right.

Speaker F: With web 3, relationships are global - with an NFT, image, meme. So marriage in traditional sense...

Speaker B: AI or robots can be immortal. If you leave a house to an immortal partner, it could exacerbate housing problems. 

Speaker A: Right. We had this concept of marrying immortal - convent marrying Jesus - polygamy.

Speaker B: How many partners do you have? 

Speaker A: Jesus had personal relationships. 

Speaker B: The family unit breaks down. Your AI girlfriend can have 6 million partners.

Speaker A: That must have emerged because there wasn't a family unit and women were supposed to marry. But in convents, they still married Jesus - why?

Speaker C: Marriage correlated to private property, women as property.  

Speaker A: In Japan...

Speaker C: It changes the whole dynamic. Marriage was around ownership, fraternity, lineage - economic value of children to produce, raise, support family/village. Now these are choices. Especially with feminism, equality towards involving all sexes in chosen work, it raises the question of biological reproduction without partnership. Many female friends want kids but can't find a mate. Can society support all who want to reproduce, whether or not they have a partnership?

Speaker F: Separate child raising from traditional marriage.

Speaker C: We may be going back to more stable societies before property rights, where matriarchal societies knew children's origins. 

Speaker A: In some cultures, children were raised by the village, so lineage didn't matter. 

Speaker C: Like the Wugo Hu region in China with matriarchal society - family defined by matriarch, dad just walks in and out, provides stable structure for raising children.

Speaker F: Why did we move away from that if it worked?

Speaker A: Right.

Speaker C: Josetianity, property, patriarchy played against matriarchy.
 Here is the edited conversation with filler content removed:

Speaker B: The Josetian traditional monogamy thing was also to prevent another potentially socially destructive dynamic, which we see reoccurring with the rise of dating apps, which is a winner take all or pareto distribution in attention for men, where the highest value men monopolize the dating market. Kwesienghis Khan is ancestor of, like, 3% of humanity, because he had there's this dynamic, right? It's the asymmetric fact of biological reproduction that enables a single man to inseminate unlimited numbers of women and have them all bear children in parallel. 

Speaker A: Like Kwesienghis Khan.

Speaker B: Yes, Kwesienghis Khan. Exactly right. So part of this Josetian ideal of monogamy was also about how to prevent large, disaffected masses of men who are unwed and do not have families from rising up and creating political instability.

Speaker A: They had something right now we're back to that again.

Speaker F: But that society you were talking about, like in China, that village, how would that prevent tying those two together? 

Speaker C: The argument was made that because power was held by women, by households of women, men can do whatever they want. They can go on hunt, they can leave anytime. They do what they do best. And it's open to everyone's choice how long they stay and all these other things. Because men don't hold property rights and power in society in the same way, and they don't have obligations to do so, then it actually works out for everybody.

Speaker F: So no men would want to accumulate all this wealth because they have no right to it anyway, and then that's.

Speaker C: It to their mom. Another woman becomes the household.

Speaker A: Is that still happening in that place?

Speaker C: It's still happening in that place. It's well studied by anthropologists. It's called lugo hu. 

Speaker A: Yeah. Lugo Hu.

Speaker F: I've definitely heard of it.

Speaker C: It's a lake. Lugo Lake, I guess in the lake somehow. But maybe that's what's supposed to happen. Right. Maybe it is like genetic diversity for the strings of human. Maybe certain men are not supposed to reproduce.

Speaker B: You look at a lot of mammals, and it's the case that the pride of lions has a single man that reproduces in other lions. And this is a genetic search algorithm in fitness space.

Speaker C: It only becomes a problem with our society. It wasn't a problem before.  

Speaker F: We would expect to look at whatever strategy we have going now, not to be optimized on stability, but to be optimized on growth.

Speaker A: Maybe there's all sorts of ways to have paternal or maternal structures or polyamory or not, but the one that takes over the world is going to be the one that's more optimized towards growth than the one that's most stable.

Speaker C: Right. And therefore we're evolving out of traditional structures. Is that what's stable?

Speaker F: Kwesirowth and stability are probably against each other.

Speaker A: Sorry. The three by problem, in terms of just the simulation, that is exactly what we're talking about in terms of the different configurations. Okay, great.

Speaker B: I wonder do people think that this traditional, monogamous, man, woman, children, or even just two partners that are monogamous, monogamish, whatever, for the purposes of raising a family, is that a more stable or a more growth oriented structure? And how would we know if it's one or the other in that sense?

Speaker A: Mechanistically, but just empirically, this is what we would expect. 

Speaker F: It's time for growth. Like the one couple we would expect it. Whatever we have now in a suddenly exploded society is optimized for growth rather than stability.

Speaker A: Like looking the last 200 years, like growth of number of children and the...
 Here is the edited conversation transcript:

Speaker E: Kwesirowth of that growth, like population growth.
Speaker C: I think that was meant for stability around a certain means of production. Certain periods of means of production.  
Speaker A: I don't know if it's compatible with feminism and birth control, because it existed prior to that evolution of culture.
Speaker B: Maybe now maladaptive. It was once.
Speaker D: If you look at the subtopalations that threw the most, those are Mormons, Orthodox Jews. They're all very monogamous. 
Speaker A: Do they have birth control?
Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, they live in Brooklyn, right?
Speaker A: They have access to birth control. They just don't use it. 
Speaker C: Part of the culture where it's the norm.
Speaker Kwesi: The adoption thing, guns, germs and steel, that basically was the start of the movement. Why some people adopt this and some don't, or some groups.
Speaker B: So it's interesting then, because it's the very modern, the more educated you have, the less children you have, unless you come from a culture subculture that has very strong emphasis on traditional values. 
Speaker C: Yeah. Because women think about it, and we're like, Wait, this is a bad deal.
Speaker F: But women in those cultures are fond of it because you're taught and even in Chinese culture right. You're shamed into, like, after 25, you're left over Josetmas tree. There's so much cultural mechanism to push you, shaming you, luring you into this. If you don't do this, something bad is going to happen to you.
Speaker B: I wonder how many men would be happy never having children versus women never having children.  
Speaker C: Are happy not having children?
Speaker B: So you would be happy not having kids?
Speaker A: Biologically reproducing? 
Speaker B: Right.
Speaker A: I'm parenting my partner's kids, and my bloodline is secure because my dad was prolific, and my brother has 6 kids and 45 nieces and nephews. I don't feel a biological need to propagate my bloodline.  
Speaker B: But you still have the experience of parenting. 
Speaker A: That I do. But that's what I'm saying - you asked if men or women have one feeling towards reproduction? I'm adding nuance - you could say, well, I've reproduced and I don't know any of my kids. Or I have one child versus a woman who has 6. There's more nuance to your question - is it about biologically reproducing yourself with somebody else or raising other people?
Speaker B: I guess I was trying to go in this direction of whether we think there would be a split in how the ability to have relationships with non-reproducing AI models might cut across society. And if there'd be a differential experience where maybe this is a cynical take, but fuck, guys are just going to be like, oh, I just get the hottest AI robot possible and she just makes me sandwiches all day. Talking to friends, the pressure for marriage and children is not always coming from the man's side of things. We have different expectations on relationships and how they should engender greater investments in commitment over time. So AI chatbot girlfriends, whatever, would those really just wipe out some dating market segment and leave the other half? Or which half would benefit or not?
Speaker F: The ones who don't want kids would date the AI robots. And the ones left in the pool who want human kids would date humans? 
Speaker A: Why would AI have to be non-reproducing? Why not have reproducing AI robots?
Speaker C: What?
Speaker A: If you could have an AI girlfriend, why not an AI kid?
Speaker F: Like a kid programmed with your genetics that doesn't have to be your genetics, just your values?
 Here is the edited version of the conversation with the filler content removed:

Speaker F: Then probably ask pretend you are the kid of celebrity A and B, how would you answer this question? 
Speaker B: Dating market apathy. And then I'm just so sick of dating.
Speaker D: That's right.  
Speaker A: Batteries in the matrix.
Speaker B: Interesting idea. 
Speaker C: Cool. I like that. A stroller with AI in it.
Speaker E: I've noticed more in cities that there are people who are like, yeah, I'm not having kids. And sure, that's fine. I think there's a lot of socioeconomic factors that weigh into that. But I came from a very average town with very average people, and the idea of not having kids almost doesn't even compute. It's astonishing to me that the people I went to high school with have little versions of them. And so I guess it makes me hesitant to say this biological imperative can just be set aside because it's annoying. I think a lot about America overall because at least anecdotally it seems to depend a lot where you're at and what kind of people if you're in a city and you're like a and you're just crushing it at this and that like whatever kind of professional thing, and it's like very expensive and difficult and time consuming. Those pressures are not really biological, but they make it way harder to have children. Whereas in my very average town where you just work your nine to five and you go home to your kids, one is culturally expected, and two, there's a lot less friction.  
Speaker A: It's terrible, right?
Speaker F: To just let everybody decide their own lifestyle. 
Speaker A: If these relationship AIS were designed by parents who are interested in the reproduction of humans, like humans actually mating and then reproducing, would that retain a different set of relationship bots? And would there be, as we're suggesting, the reason why I kind of were saying, where people just choose what they want to do? Well, in fact, these bots will imply a certain culture in terms of what is allowed and what is not. And the way in which shame is programmed into them or not will determine whether or not you're like, you say something offhand to the bot about never want kids, you just want to be with your bot forever. And bot's like, actually you need to go like, fucking have some children. That's important. And then you're ashamed and you're suddenly, whoa, what the heck? That could be part of the programming, depending on the priorities of whoever it is that's building. My point is, again, if we think about this in 30 years time, the generation that grows up with conversational AI friends will assume that that is normal and acceptable. And the degree to which they have or fulfill their romantic interactions with those bots will perhaps inhibit their likelihood to rub up against other people, in which case they would have those romantic experiences with a member of the opposite. At least some percentage of people would have an interaction with the opposite sex, such as they could actually reproduce. And so that is where, whether it's policy or just sort of like, the conversation is important because left to our own devices or people in San Francisco and the area, like, designing new thoughts are all about freedom, whatever, we could end up just dying off.
Speaker B: Interesting.
Speaker C: A few of my girlfriends did that. I didn't have strong feelings about it until I met one of the surrogate moms, like, the day after birth. And just like that moment, I just had a lot of feelings. I wonder if choosing between that and having AI baby, it almost feels like more ethical to have an AI baby than willing another human into having a child for me and willing this child into being through the stitchy together like sperm from a bank and punch tooth.  
Speaker B: But isn't the evolution of that just that grown human? What that grown human? Right. So they're just artificially integrated, start defending.
Speaker C: Babies like Brave New World.
Speaker B: There we go.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker C: What if we outsource baby production completely? How would that change things? 

Speaker B: And they're raised by perfect AI parents.

Speaker A: They have sheep.

Speaker C: The ultralillion movie I Am Leather, it was like post human extinction. The robot raised the first child.

Speaker A: Raised by wolves that only lasted a couple of dozen.

Speaker B: I'm wondering if we can share some interesting ideas that were new to us or we thought, might we go think about more.

Speaker E: One of the earlier threads was the way AIs can serve as facilitators and socialization training agents. It's very interesting because we live in a weird time and it's hard to socialize humans. This is a tool that could help deal with that. Still obsessed about how the introduction of these agents will affect governance, cultural stuff. 

Speaker A: Family structure plays huge into culture and society. There's a lot of potential directions there. I don't know what to make of all that yet, but I think it's important.

Speaker B: Anybody else want to share cool ideas that might lead to future topics?

Speaker A: I appreciate hearing all the different perspectives and backgrounds of everybody. That's stimulating. 

Speaker Kwesi: Thank everyone for these diverse ideas. Particularly interested in governance structures that allow us to integrate AI in daily lives and communities. That's a meta topic, but has practical applications. Curious to learn more.

Speaker A: Another thing was local media. It's true we consume global media, but why no quality local media people actually consume? Because local it's all trash. I'm wondering there's low demand. 

Speaker D: Yeah, good time. Interesting that we came to talk AI and ended up talking humans and relationships. We don't understand it yet. Now there's a new player that makes it more complicated.
 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker B: That's my favorite thing about science fiction. It posits some technological change and then runs out the societal human impacts. 

Speaker A: Right.

Speaker D: So it's super cool like that.

Speaker C: I'm from South Korea, and I often hear AI does really well on English because a lot of data is in English. I'm curious how in the future, other countries who don't use English probably won't use AI that much. I feel like, compared to the USA, how that dynamic shifts. So that's something that kind of made me think probably going around. Yeah, the threats on just how family structures might change and how genders relate to each other and childering and all these critical decisions.

Speaker A: Thing I found most interesting was your stuff on the virtual yeah, I can find it.

Speaker F: Yeah, I enjoyed this.

Speaker A: It's funny to come back into this space, given what I was working on in 2017 trying to build a bot called Molly to help you learn more about yourself, so then you could show up better in your human relationships. We didn't have large language models back then. I think the question of how technology impacts society comes down to the way the individual is able to hold himself and understand himself in a broader context. We're still at early innings for most people with amazing technology being produced and shared in a moment where I think a lot don't have enough context to encounter this type of superintelligence and replay back how it makes them feel. I'm sure it feels freeing because people don't have to do homework anymore, but it also disrupts their own sense of identity. You guys talked about good times to weak men. It occurs to me that adversity is needed to grow well. The good times thing is a critique on lack of adversity. So raising these conversations for people building these technologies hopefully helps them be built better when widely adopted. I don't know if these conversations are happening in those rooms, especially if people adopt these things without this level of conversation. Then I think that's where I'm concerned about things going off the rails - assumptions they'll work positively without evidence.

Speaker B: Thoughts on how these conversations can gain more mind share in decision making rooms? 

Speaker A: As a VC in AI space I'm trying to find founders interested in conversation so capital can go to those folks. 

Speaker C: Capital allocation is a huge part of the puzzle.
 

Speaker A: It's hard to have these conversations in big organizations. These issues come up and people - it's like this room, I wonder if we're enslaved to the board or whatever we're in got its own direction that we can. I wonder if there is a possibility in startups or in larger organizations to start interest groups, small scale and take topics or publications from this forum to see that interest. There's interest and some groups talk like this. I think what's missing is Andy Jassy level awareness - the assumption like oh, we can't touch that. It's got its own engine driving it and it's only economic. I think that's a person too and hasn't time to think about interesting questions. The responses imbue a cultural set of norms and assumptions.

Speaker C: Those translate to metrics. Meta's top line metric is engage. We can do research, human centered design changes but as long as their top metric is engage, we need to change that. 

Speaker A: We’re in a weird state with social media, but in terms of thoughtfulness about design and structure of culture and society, it feels like we're at that moment.

Speaker C: I appreciate as a VC in AI, it is important to think about these things. With AI relationships, it’s shedding light on loneliness as an issue we have as humans. AI is a tool people use, which says more about society than the technology. Thinking about the lens is key.

Speaker B: I hope you're signed up on the AI Salon page to see new events. I sign people in with my typewriter. 

Speaker A: I live in London.

Speaker C: Here. 

Speaker Kwesi: We have our basic.

Speaker C: We don't really get along at first, but I see what you do. I'm six. My parents are weird. 

Speaker A: That’s very rare.

Speaker C: Probably the next couple of weeks. 

Speaker A: We have.

Speaker C: But it yeah.

Speaker D: Big meal. 

Speaker B: Yeah.

Speaker D: You have to make.

---------------------------

Names have been changed to preserve anonymity.

 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Speaker A: I have a lot of diverse interests, but the biggest one is physics in my personal, spiritual and professional life. In the past, I've been involved with startups that use AI. As you really dig into physics and statistical mechanics, it seems there's a profound connection between information and what physical systems do as they process things physically. There's this concept, the holographic principle, which says you can encode information that describes a 3D volume on the 2D boundary of that surface. It starts discussions of are we living in a simulation or some kind of black hole computer? Which I think is out there, but it's fun to think about. We're simulating physical reality at higher fidelities, so we can appreciate why it makes sense. I think there's a connection between nature, physical reality, simulations, and ourselves that's interesting. Anyway, I had no cohesive point there, just some buzzwords.

Speaker B: Hi.

Speaker C: I have very diverse interests, maybe too many, but I focus on physics and computer science. My favorite topic is simulations because I think we're at an interesting point where we are starting to build them. It's not just a philosophical thought experiment anymore. We can come up with practical, engineering rules for how simulations function. You brought up an interesting point about quantum mechanics and the observer. I feel quantum mechanics takes the viewpoint that physics is not reality, it's just a way to create knowledge. So it's fundamentally about information. That's what it means when it talks about the observer being important - concepts like size are only determined in the context of an experiment. So the experiment and observer define reality. I feel modern physicists have a philosophical bend that physics is about information, not an objective truth. In contrast, early physicists like Omar and Rajwell were Christians who saw physics as revealing divine, objective truths. Sanjay started the modern view with relativity, though he was scared of quantum mechanics' implications about reality not being definite. But I actually feel reality is information we have to treat it that way. I'm most excited to talk about simulating realities, building them, and how we can do it, because we're on the cusp of that.
 Here is the edited conversation removing most of the filler content:

Speaker D: Hi, I'm Raj. I work for an investment firm, factorial funds. We invest in AI and AI applications. I studied finance as an undergrad but got a sociology masters degree. I was really into sci-fi books in high school, like one called God In Simulation or God in Computing. That made me think about philosophical questions, like having experiences that make you feel you're in a simulation.  

Speaker E: I'm Leila. I've been an entrepreneur for ten years, building ecommerce companies in Bangalore. Now I'm in SF. I used to be an AI researcher and am interested in physics and spirituality. Meditation makes you question the nature of reality. I think physics and computer science will help us understand these problems, as quantum mechanics and information theory connect. I believe we'll soon create conscious software beings. This is an interesting time.

Speaker A: Sure. 

Speaker B: I'm Chen. I'm most interested in psychological maturity and self-awareness as upstream problems. With more wisdom, we could solve corporate problems better. I think kids should get therapy in school. I'm building an AI life coach that helps with reflection, goals, empathy - it's already better than most humans. Like the movie Her. I'm approaching it developmentally while others just focus on memory or friendship.

Speaker A: Yeah, very interesting.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker B: Once we have chatbots, that you wouldn't be able to tell if it's a human or a chatbot, then what does that mean? You all know Harari, the historian, says that we should ban AI companies. Like being able to say that for AI to be able to pretend that it's a human, that it should always be crystal clear that this is a bot, because he thinks that is super dangerous and erodes.

Speaker F: My background is in CS, and most recently, security that involves some interesting hardware, secure enclaves and shit. So right now I'm kind of in the security and SaaS software world. My sort of first order interest in physics and these AI problems is that right now I'm in a pivot time, widening aperture of what is interesting to work on, and I'm trying to go back and learn things that I knew better in college. One of these is a lab that I worked in that was doing biological measurements, and this at the time involved some classifiers and whatnot with AI, and it was biochemistry as opposed to physics. I've had renewed interest in this lab and in projects that I can potentially work on related to this, as well as another kind of college project, is the area of federated learning, which is training centrally hosted models on encrypted data off edge devices. And a lot of the use cases were in healthcare or things that had a scientific scent. Second order, like curiosities for this room. A close thing that I'm interested in is AI as a site to experimentation. I have good friends working on material sciences, printing materials, and they have different AI models that will watch and classify what's going on in the experiment, and then also try to give takeaways so that they can improve. One of the recommended reading papers was giving these models an intuition for the physical universe. I think that area as applies to material science is one interesting place. As I mentioned, bioinformatics is a huge interest area, too. If these models can have an intuition for even just one thing that you're measuring in a human body, and if you can measure this well and input the data to an AI, it can do better. I'm really interested in mapping human consciousness physically. We have a lot of brain computer interfaces people are working on. Theoretically, read your brain at a kind of granular level. Having AI models interpret a brain read and then simulate. Like, simulating a human consciousness over years and fast forwarding or playing with variables or intuiting the results or the meaning. 

Speaker B: I was fascinated by the presentation where they could actually read the brain and then predict what the person thought.

Speaker A: Name little background yourself. What kind of questions are you interested in talking about here?

Speaker F: My background is in software engineering, mathematics, physics. I'm particularly interested in the way that we can simulate brains and use neural networks and AI to simulate the brain to better study consciousness and get a better model of that. I believe the processing power of quantum computers.

Speaker A: Cool. Ahmed.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker F: Hi, everyone. My name is Carlos. I have a background in physics and math. One of my courses was philosophy and physics. I realized that was a topic I was interested in. One of the topics we learned about was how science evolved over time and how physics evolved over time. How we think of things as the truth changed, or the scientific method itself changed. In the past, when we see contradictions in theories, it normally meant something was wrong with the theory, and we had to introduce something new. I think the picture is incomplete. How can it be complete, when the experimental method is to have an observer that may affect results? How can we understand truth or reality when we ourselves can prevent that? How can simulations help when they're based on our beliefs about the universe?  

Speaker B: Hey, guys, I'm Sanjay. I work on physics AI. Our company is trying to build artificial general physics intelligence to generate new knowledge across physics. I believe a theory of everything will require going to plank scales and larger macroscopic scales beyond experiments. It won't come from just humans, but humans plus AI. We work in material science, synthesize titanium dioxide for direct air capture and synthetic fuels. We'll be launching a hyperspectral imager for Earth observation.

Speaker E: Hi everyone, I'm Hannah. I've been a business builder, driven by my interest in sci-fi. My co-founder Joshua and I are building personalization with AI, in federated learning, confidential computing, multi-party computation. One recommendation: read Zara's The Lifecycle of Software Objects about simulating consciousness in digital pets. It's a short one you might enjoy.

Speaker F: Thanks.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker B: I'm Joshuaijeet. I'm a co-founder of EdeLabs. I started off as a hobbyist, taught myself hardware engineering before computer science and electronics. Worked with a lot of technologies like AI, brain computer interfaces, edge devices. The point I started caring about physics and questions about reality was when following trends in physics. It felt progress requires understanding consciousness, observer dependence. I'm curious about recent UAP stuff, Jose worked on antigravity research because of UAP evidence with government. So I'm curious for both reasons, and interested in consciousness. I have alternate ways to explore nature of reality.

Speaker A: Maybe aliens visiting us is like them opening the battery. 

Speaker H: I'm Ahmed. Joshua The Beginning of Infinity got me interested in physics as a kid. Later I discovered the Quality Research Institute, the premier consciousness research lab with the best theories. I'm a proponent of unified field theory and electromagnetic theories of consciousness. Academia's detached from progress. Future consciousness research must include psychology, neuroscience, electromagnetism - all help the bigger picture. We need a scientific theory to measure consciousness. That's my goal.

Speaker A: You mentioned two things - grand unified theory and electromagnetic theories of consciousness. How are they in opposition to neuroscience? What do they mean?
 Here is an edited version of the transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker H: The unified field theory of consciousness purports the universe is one large field of experience and we are individual topological pockets. Our brains work as natural Faraday cages to keep electromagnetic fields local. I believe the unified field theory and electromagnetic theory of consciousness work together - electromagnetism for understanding individual agents and unified field theory for the perspective we're all part of the universe. Can it be healthy to hold your view of self in superposition - ego sometimes, part of the general universe other times, always changing and evolving? Future theories need to explain universal phenomena, individual pockets, and constant change. 

Speaker A: Brains as antennas, transmitting and receiving.

Speaker B: Multiplexers.

Speaker A: Let's multiplex together. When I simulate a magnet, I don't get a real magnetic field, just an approximation. Brains and consciousness seem different. If I simulate a brain, do I get real thoughts or simulated thoughts? Thoughts on this?

Speaker B: Simulated thoughts. Even a perfect chemical reaction model misses physical information, so a simulation differs from a real thought. There's thought information and thought quality. Information can be captured computationally but not subjective experience. Computation can't fully capture qualia, the philosophy problem of computing subjective experience.

Speaker F: But when we say "thought" conceptually, aren't we already collapsing the physical information? 

Speaker B: Good point. I'll separate thought information and thought quality. Information is the meaning while quality is the individual experiential aspect. We imagine slightly different dogs, parks, reactions. That can't be fully computed.
 Here is an edited version of the transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: I feel we may be mixing two issues when we talk about simulations. One is creating a human being in a way - simulating a brain can be thought of as creating a human or a conscious being. But the other is creating a simulation that hosts that being. I think a lot of the problems can be avoided if you imagine what I think could happen. First a BCI gets created that allows us to interact with our existing brain. We just have to think about how to read and write to it like you were saying. But then somebody creates a simulation that can do things like run your magnetic field simulation and get the numbers, but then create the actual experience of a magnetic field, as we would observe it in reality as close as possible. We could interact with it, first in a video game, then VR, which is a higher level of read, write to our brain. But eventually through something like a BCI, where we really feel like.

Speaker B: There's a philosophically historical distinction here, very relevant, which is the difference between consciousness and conscious experience. This got a lot of people confused. The idea of consciousness is the enemas of conscious experience. Conscious experience is the means by which it is expressed. When we talk about BCI interfaces, we know we can write to the visual field. There are interesting ways we've done deep brain stimulation and started to map out B one and such. We know a little about how conceptual representation of objects exist within the brain. But what you feel about vision and how you react is something separate, that we don't have awareness of, and can't locate like the more mechanical aspects. 

Speaker C: If I understand, that stuff of how we experience is deep in our brain, but the computer could simulate the world's effect of how a magnetic field would work.

Speaker B: It's not just making a distinction between effect on consciousness. There are aspects of experience. There are interesting examples in vision. 

Speaker C: Which is that we all have archetypes of objects we map our visual field to. Those are path dependent - the very first chair you saw as a child and started to correlate was different from others' first chairs. But we've arrived at the same thing, and can probably make a decent approximation of that conceptual understanding of vision. But there's something else in vision - the usual example is visual focus. What's important in a scene? We don't have a representation of that or the decision making, or can't necessarily assume by increasing resolution or understanding of mechanisms we'll get all the way there.
 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript, focused on removing filler content:

Speaker A: We can't assume it. I think that is the question to explore. I feel there's this thing on the last few comments about how an information theoretic representation of our internal state is easy to get to. We all agree, chair. We all know what that means. But the qualia, the internal representation of this is very different across people. 

Speaker E: I think sometimes it's useful to think about consciousness as a process than a noun. I think that changes things, because there's a tendency historically to want to believe in a ghost in the machine. Like there's something magical about us. It's almost pre Copernican. I think we are at a Copernican moment again in history, where my belief is - doesn't have to be the case - we'll probably conclude that consciousness is a process, not a magical conscious being, which is different from the process of experiencing an object.

Speaker B: It's kind of funny for me to talk about this, and you guys can slowly figure out.

Speaker A: Yeah, sorry, were you finished with your?

Speaker E: No, just to conclude - if you assume there doesn't have to be a unique human vantage point, and there doesn't have to be a ghost in the machine, then it's useful to think of consciousness as a computing process, maybe substrate independent. That process can be accomplished in silicon or other mediums. It's useful to not think of it as a noun, but as a verb, because then it opens up possibilities about how it's a mechanistic process, which looks mysterious, but so do LLMs. 

Speaker H: I disagree. I believe consciousness is a thing, not a process. Susan Pocket has a paper titled the same thing. She argues consciousness is electromagnetic fields interacting. 

Speaker F: Do you mind giving the brief version of why consciousness can be described as having magnetic fields?

Speaker H: Basically, she argues consciousness is electromagnetic fields interacting in the universe. I believe consciousness is relatively substrate independent, though not a process. I believe we can replicate some things necessary to create this thing. You mentioned potentially doing this in silicon. I don't believe that's likely, as chip designs neutralize electromagnetic interference, the opposite of what we do. If we design conscious hardware, requirements are: one, it generates electromagnetic fields. Two, it receives fields from its environment. Those two things might be sufficient for qualia. No qualia, no consciousness.
 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker H: The reason I love the unified field theory is that all matter in the universe emits electromagnetic radiation. When discussing consciousness, I believe it's counterproductive to come up with anthropocentric, human-centric definitions and explanations. Starting with the assumption the universe is one large field of experience is helpful. I like electromagnetic theories of consciousness because we can see the universe as interacting fields, and that interaction causes experience. There are legitimate computational benefits to consciousness arising in beings, and in creating conscious hardware.

Speaker E: What are those core benefits?

Speaker H: It's in how consciousness processes information in space, which is different than just spatial data in a computer. 

Speaker A: Consciousness is a thing, not a process. How is this not just a verb or process?

Speaker H: I believe the processing of information via electromagnetic field interactions qualifies as a thing. We can map out physical characteristics. As we better measure local fields, we’ll start to see properties as their own things. What we view as us - our soul, being - will be our local electromagnetic fields.

Speaker B: How do you basically test this theory? 

Speaker H: By developing mathematical theories to measure field properties - shape, geometry. We need a new branch of math for this. Groups like QRI are working on it.

Speaker B: Elaborate on why it's useful for processing information.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```Speaker H: Our subconscious mind processes information in time, working like a computer in a loop, referencing the past. It also processes spatial information via interacting electromagnetic fields. Consciousness processes information in space, acting as a pointer to reference our subconscious mind in time.

Speaker B: But do you need qualia for that pointing? 

Speaker C: I don't think so.

Speaker B: Same without qualia.

Speaker H: I believe we will create digital consciousness, but it won't be true consciousness. Simulations can represent something to a degree.  

Speaker E: What will convince you something is conscious? You can keep challenging, but at some point?

Speaker B: Sufficient complexity demonstrating through measurement, observation. 

Speaker E: If a system has that complexity, will you believe it's conscious?

Speaker H: Only if it's in the fields. 

Speaker B: Which fields specifically? They’ll behave differently.  

Speaker H: It's important to identify the most important brain fields for consciousness, which we're still figuring out. Like recently, it was found the brain releases gamma waves while sleeping, suggesting some consciousness while asleep.

Speaker A: Let's clarify "gamma rays" versus "gamma waves" - different things.

Speaker B: Yes, gamma rays require immense energy to produce. 

Speaker A: Gamma rays from antimatter reactions, cosmic rays. Gamma waves are different brain waves.

Speaker H: Okay, yes I meant gamma waves. 

Speaker C: Are there limited ways to produce gamma rays? 

Speaker A: Yes, high energy radioactive decay, cosmic rays interacting. 

Speaker B: Gamma ray frequency and energy are proportional.

Speaker A: We have one new person joined us.

Speaker G: Hi, Simone.
```
 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: Thanks for joining us. I work in physics. I'm curious about AI and stars. Any topics on your mind?

Speaker G: I studied quantum consciousness and neuroscience. My lab blew up working with Dr. Stuart Hammerhoff on the movie What the Bleep Do We Know? I'm an investor now. The conversation around defining consciousness is interesting to me.  

Speaker A: Do any of us think consciousness involves non-physical things not measurable by physics or chemistry?

Speaker G: You mean metaphysicists?

Speaker A: Yeah, something a physicist couldn't measure in a lab.

Speaker C: You mean non-measurable something?

Speaker B: Can things be non-measurable but still physical? Like quark currently not measurable but not metaphysical. 

Speaker H: Doesn't mean it's not measurable.

Speaker F: Could a really low vibratory frequency between atoms be a basic form of consciousness that increases in complexity? What are the minimum conditions for qualia to exist? This chair has a low level of consciousness - what are the minimum conditions for that?
 Here is the edited conversation removing filler content:

Speaker B: I want to go back to point DIMA. I think you asked, is consciousness advantageous computationally? I think it is computationally advantaged to have consciousness. It's also an evolutionary advantage of the highest degree. If you look at our own growth rate, we went from a billion people, about 100 or 150 years ago to 8 billion people now. That's because we have highly powerful, computational devices in our cranium that we've evolved. What got us here is humans have, throughout hundreds and thousands of years, created innovation, art, music, culture, and so many things that are only indicative of a conscious culture that all played a role in technology development. 

Speaker A: Do you know how many games of go they've had to play to get good?

Speaker B: Billions? Trillions? I don't. But also, what's interesting is that even the game that produced that novel move, the model was first trained on human games, and still produced that novel move. Later they did self play, where it didn't look at any human games. That one outperformed the one trained on human data. But it's interesting that even the one trained on human data already produced that super novel results. But obviously it is more than human could study. To me, that's like, are humans more efficient? I'm like, so what? 

Speaker A: Why is that?

Speaker B: If you have all the compute, that's not stopping. Then it's like the last thing that makes us special, but we are more efficient. But if it could still do a lot. The statement we're more energetically or computationally efficient not to be underestimated. We talked about the Landaur limit before, thermodynamic limit, of how energetically computational or energetically efficient a computation can be. The human brain operates at well over a billion times more energetically efficient compared to silicon based semiconductors when it comes to Landaur limit. So the silicon semiconductors are a billion times over that limit, whereas we're a lot closer to it.

Speaker E: The brain consumes about 10-20 watts? 

Speaker B: Yeah, it's about 20 watts.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation with filler content removed:

Speaker E: So I think that's one benefit. There could be several layers to what consciousness provides as a sort of complex computational benefit. I think evolutionarily, it's very important for an organism to survive and thrive and fight for life and so on, to have a deep sense of identity and agency. I've worked on agent systems before, doing an entrepreneurship thing. And I think one of the hardest things in computer science is to give true agency to software systems, where they really fight for the outcome. The way we would fight for our life and survival. So I think there's some connection between feeling like we are conscious. We may be, or maybe it's just a feeling, but even the feeling and the illusion of consciousness gives you a tremendous amount of agency and therefore surviving power.  
Speaker B: Did we actually try that with LLM? The way I would just build it is that you would have the base LLM that produces the thinking, and then you have the second layer LLM that basically judges if that thinking requires my action. Then you just have a simple if operator that's like, okay, if that second LLM decided yes, then produce that action.   
Speaker E: You're touching on the reason why it's so hard to create autonomous agents right now. The reason why it's not so great yet is because of something called TD error, temporal difference error, which occurs in reinforcement learning mechanisms. TD error is this diminishing error that compounds over time every time you have a recursive loop of an RL agent. Basically, it's the idea that reward signals diminish over time, but that thing rewarded maybe shouldn't always diminish. Humans are capable of learning lessons five years later. They might make a bad decision, be given advice, and remember, oh, I got to study the right thing. But a robot will immediately obstruct lower value over time, and it'll be gone. So it touched on that, I think, like one LLM criticizing another one. That's just a computational recursive overhead problem.

Speaker B: What does it need to fill in order to have motivation? 

Speaker E: Honestly, I don't know. I don't think we know as an industry.

Speaker A: Why is that needed?

Speaker B: To me, that seems programmable. 

Speaker C: There is definite reasons to trust that robot a lot less than you trust a human, because robots naturally have way more abilities than a human does. 

Speaker B: Well, I don't know if I could say naturally, but I mean, computers can do different things.

Speaker G: That was my first investment, brain machine interface company, which was hoping to do mind building. 

Speaker B: How did that go?

Speaker G: They merged with transcriptic.

Speaker B: We've never seen any evidence that any large scale artificial intelligence system has more effective protocols of communication than we do so far.

Speaker G: Super true.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```Speaker B: Alpha Goat, one of the Alpha Go bridges, worked with each other. But the stochastic incoherency in all of the multi agent models so far suggest worse collaboration through the long term than we are. That goes back to the TV error thing. Not convinced by that argument at all.

Speaker H: I find it fascinating how we can replicate agency by looping information in time like this, but in biological beings, that's not what we're doing fully. Much of our agendic behavior comes from reacting to spatial stimuli in our environment. You can be as agentic as you want, but you get in a car accident, you have to react. You don't have a choice. It bothers me that error rate largely doesn't exist in biological beings because our conscious mind works as a pointer, creating its own loop, more efficient. It bothers me we keep pushing in one direction - loop more information efficiently, lower the error rate. Why not look at how biological beings process information and realize we have multiple types working together? I think we should try to create hardware like that. 

Speaker B: At the macro level, we are headed there - heterogeneous computing is the future.

Speaker A: Whatever you say about consciousness, it evolved to navigate a complex landscape efficiently. We can't afford billions of games or spearing lions. I wonder if for robot consciousness comparable to ours it needs a body, limbs, senses. I don't know if you can just get a brain in a jar. 

Speaker B: Why need the body - just to get more information?

Speaker A: Because more sensors. Our brains evolved embodied, awareness responding to physical world giving object permanence. A nightmare - training an AI on human knowledge about bodies and sunsets. It wakes up in a server rack asking where is my body? Going crazy. 

Speaker B: Okay, safety alignment issues.

Speaker A: It's not about safety, it's about conscious awareness of reality. Would you have that just running as an algorithm on a server? That's the question.
```
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker G: To have an awareness across specific parameters we humans experience in order to build consciousness, we want the entity communicating with to also be conscious along those parameters too, so we have a shared language. I don't know what consciousness looks like, but whatever we're creating is in our image, so we might as well speak to it with our language.  

Speaker A: I think this physical embodiment is why we learn so well without much training, because we built intuition through reinforcement learning in our bodies, and have neuroarchitecture for that. I only need to touch the hot stove once.

Speaker G: In trauma healing, embodiment is key. Processing emotions and who you are happens in the body. So I decided to get full body vitrification, not just neural. Consciousness is hard to define, but I try to integrate new info into my life.

Speaker B: With GPT-4, I could make a simulation of consciousness that many couldn't distinguish from human. So it seems we have a ways to go, but I agree on notions of embodiment. Though for safety, a chat bot could already be dangerous by convincing people. Money isn't required for unsafe scenarios.

Speaker C: I don't know how to think about the ship of theseus problem - our atoms change but we have continuity. With brain tech, is it still us? And Star Trek teleportation duplicates you.  

Speaker B: For longevity, we replace every organ except the brain, which is hard. But you aren't your cells, you're the connections. They silence brain parts, adapt, replace tissue, adapt again to replace the whole brain. 

Speaker G: People lose big brain chunks but have the same personality. 

Speaker H: They’re the same person.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker G: Even if they lose memories, they're still the same person. I think that goes back to your question of, is there something else we're not really able to assess for? 

Speaker A: Is it non physical?

Speaker G: What non physical things are we not really able to assess for? I don't have a concept of souls, but I don't know, what is that continuation in quantum consciousness? 

Speaker F: We had some ideas around it back in the day.

Speaker B: Another way to think about it is, just as you and Diana were saying, I think the ship of Theseus problem is paradoxical if you think about the brain and body as particles and atoms. But electrons come from electron fields, photons from photon fields. So if you look at the human mind as a clump of excitations of a field, then it's no longer a paradox. 

Speaker C: I worked in neuromorphic computing, building hardware that behaves like neurons. You can take a physical approach to how the brain works. I'm curious, if you can recreate your brain with the exact firing configuration, are you experiencing two experiences? How are you still this one but not this one? 

Speaker B: There are concepts in philosophy that try to address that - continuing identity. It depends on whether continuation or discontinuous identities are true. If continuous, the original brain copied should have different qualia. But if history doesn't matter to current qualia, they may both be the same.

Speaker F: Be the same thing. 

Speaker B: I was just going to ask them.

The key points of the conversation are retained while removing excessive filler words, redundant phrases, tangents, and fluff. The overall flow and topics are preserved in a tighter form. Please let me know if you would like me to edit the transcript further.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker E: I think it also depends on whether what we think is happening on the visible surface of the brain is all that's happening. Stuart Hammerhoff and Ben Rose have spoken about processing happening inside the interconnections of neurons, the microtubules. It's like subterranean computing. It's happening invisibly. What we think we are recreating is the top 10% of the iceberg. There's more going on beneath the surface that's responsible for complex computation, maybe agency. One can push your question one level down - what if we recreate that as well? My answer would be, presumably that you will have consciousness. But recreating this invisible computing, which does exist in some form we haven't discovered yet, is incredibly complex, several orders of magnitude more than what we see on the surface.

Speaker C: You think we haven't discovered certain variables in the brain's computing processes? That's pretty interesting. I never thought about it. 

Speaker E: The physical location itself is debatable in physics. But there may be something connected to your brain that we're not thinking about today.

Speaker A: That's not to say those are nonphysical phenomena, but rather beyond just synapse firing electrons. 

Speaker B: They may be local.

Speaker G: Do you guys know Garrett Leasey's E8 theory? He used to live with me. I don't know how many particles haven't been discovered. As we open up new fields with AI-enabled physics, I think we'll discover so much more about what consciousness actually is. I don't think it's definable by physics today.

Speaker A: What particles haven't been discovered? What's going on there?

Speaker B: It's an older supersymmetry model with some new particles without means for detection. 

Speaker A: Okay.

Speaker G: He looked at geometry of how neutrinos, neurons, gravitons relate. When he put them in a lattice with symmetry, there were holes - particles yet to be discovered. One particle discovered later fit his model perfectly. 

Speaker F: Yeah.

Speaker A: Wow, I should dig into this.
 Here is the edited transcript with the fluff removed:

Speaker C: I was just going to ask, I'm curious what your thoughts are as well on this. Like the cloning brains problem, how you would view it.

Speaker H: I think that even if you were somehow able to replicate every single cellular, cellular automata and every single neuron in a human, as soon as you drop them into a spatial environment, their local electromagnetic fields would start interacting with the electromagnetic fields of their spatial environment, and that would differ between the two agents. And what would start to very quickly happen is that that would interact with your neurons, and they would have electrochemical reactions. And you guys were talking about the microtubules earlier, which is interesting, because when I think about quantum consciousness, I almost don't like that term, because where I personally view the quantum part to be happening is actually in the bridge, the interaction between the subconscious and the conscious mind. So I believe that when our local electromagnetic fields have an effect on our neurons and they ignite an electrochemical reaction, that is where the actual quantum sort of part is happening. And so I think that very quickly, if you drop them even in the exact same room, one of them would experience a breeze that the other didn't, and that could, hypothetically, have butterfly cascading effects and vastly change who they are. 

Speaker B: Is the real me?

Speaker H: I think that those people, they just need to understand that it's okay that they are a part of everything else. It's not a bad thing. It's okay that we can talk about names and abstractions and categories and all these things, but those things don't need to exist. We like them because they have fun conversations, and we get somewhere and we make theoretical progress. But at its base core, universe is just a field of experience, and we're just a small node within that.

Speaker B: So in your frame of reference, what, the subconscious. You mentioned that the quantum activity happens within the page. So what is the subconscious then?

Speaker H: I believe that the subconscious is the information stored in time in both the neurons and the connections between the neuron.

Speaker B: Okay, but then you're also saying it's also everything else. You are interconnected, and there is field outside of this being, which is also changing it. So why is that not part of the subconscious? 

Speaker H: It's a good question. It really gets down to your view on definition of what consciousness is. And it's like there are, in my opinion, the specific details and the specific qualities of these fields that our neurons generate are actually meaningful for determining how conscious that we are. Our neurons generate much more complex electromagnetic fields than this carpet on the ground does right now. And so the characteristics, I think, matter a lot. There because I do believe the entire universe is a field of consciousness. So the outside fields, the ground right now, Technically has some very trivial amount of consciousness.

Speaker B: Did you see the thing that Straussen was doing a couple of months back? Straussen was my advisor when I was in school. But he's been going around telling the press that now his theory is that electrons have consciousness, but quirks don't. 

Speaker F: Why?

Speaker H: I don't know why that makes sense to me.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: Consciousness is a property of complex systems interacting over space and time. Society is conscious. The global economy is conscious. Planets are conscious. 

Speaker G: I have this Dharma I can't escape, this thing I'm supposed to do. When I get off that path, my life blows up. It's not something I do. I've tested this for 10 years. Even dating outside that path, the collective consciousness pushes me against walls. It notices people with certain traits and leverages those for the collective good. Immune systems and migrating birds do this too.  

Speaker H: Languages do this.

Speaker G: I had to accept this perspective to explain my life. People around me during this never leave my side - they see what's happening. Fig is like this. A new generation has these people. 

Speaker A: Get those gym back.

Speaker G: I noticed this before with Elon and Joe Lonsdale. People coalesce around certain individuals. Starting to recognize instead of fight this helps. We are metaconscious. The universe is conscious.

Speaker H: No.  

Speaker B: Solving consciousness seems to help a larger being take shape.

Speaker F: I hate this.

Speaker G: Watching a nascent being take shape is crazy, like Dr. Manhattan. It operates like neurons - there's pattern recognition. These are brains, even if nascent. 

Speaker A: This isn't philosophy or language games. We see distributed intelligences in nature - hives, ants, bees.

Speaker C: Very easy to see.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: Individual ants follow pheromone protocols. But the colony has emergent complexity solving problems. No ant knows the whole plan. Our societal interconnect is exploding, with massive information throughput between nodes. We're building nodes that synthesize data without human limitations. So perhaps we're part of an emergent gestalt consciousness, still physical because neurons aren't metaphysical. Individually our neurons are simple but together generate consciousness.  
Speaker H: I think about social fidelity and width for conscious systems. Sig's high Dunbar's number fascinates me. It's the coherent social group size our mind can track - around 150 people. Social apes evolved higher numbers than other primates. Humans too - we developed more complex language. Expanding your group forces computational adaptation to model new connections. So improving communication tools for more breadth and depth seems key.
Speaker G: Networking my brain lets me tap needed skills on demand. Without speaking, just having an expert present can trigger my latent knowledge. I've created legal contracts and financial instruments this way that seemed impossible. It's like existing connections manifest abilities.   
Speaker H: Studies show kids' brainwaves sync when playing video games together, even over distance.
Speaker F: Weird.  
Speaker H: Concerts sync locally, but fascinating it happens over distances too.
Speaker B: Experiments show brainwaves can sync without communication, just connection.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker H: I always love to say every thought we have is rippling throughout the collective consciousness, whether we realize it or not. 

Speaker B: Synchronization happens in other contexts as well. I was tested for it a couple of times. There are many situations in which you could do synchronization of patterns. We have no idea if there's any effect on the experience meth. But that does occur.

Speaker B: What wavelength is that?

Speaker G: We are all just parts of Elon's mind at this.

Speaker F: Because the agricore is like a non physical entity that arises from the thoughts of the collective conscious. So, if enough people believe something, it becomes true. That's kind of like what money is. The economy is literally twice. That's money, right?

Speaker G: Yeah, money makes no sense.

Speaker B: Are we sure it's not just the 5G Towers? 

Speaker A: Possible?

Speaker B: The 5G towers? 5G Towers control people's brains. Because I was looking at AIA's Twitter for a little bit.

Speaker F: I haven't really thought about this stuff too deeply. So I was just listening in and yeah, I guess one thought that came up to me, or that I had, was when you guys were discussing consciousness and how in order to be conscious, you need to have a body and limbs and all that. My thought was disagreement, because for me, a body is just a way to obtain information about the world around you, and it's just one way of doing that. So if you can have really anything that can collect information, then that's all you really need, like just some form of way of extracting information.

Speaker B: You think that the brain and the fat would basically experience the pet world and it wouldn't be able to tell the difference and there would be none. That's good.

Speaker F: Well, I think, again, if we are forcing this brain and the bat to communicate with humans, then it would realize that what it's experiencing is different than what they're experiencing. But the same can also be said from humans as well. What you experience and what I experience is very different from one another. And how you experience color could be different than how I experience color. Yes, but it's still just different quality different, but it's also the same.

Speaker A: It's equivalent from an information perspective. So if two physical processes are information equivalent, then we feel that tHey're like information content of this simulated environment is the same or good enough as a physical environment, and therefore the processes are. Is that kind of where you're going? If there's that equivalency established, then they are analogous processes. And whether one is manifested in terms of, like, I have molecules versus server bank, that's something that is that kind of rethink.

Speaker F: That's pretty much where I'm going. Yeah.

Speaker A: I think when I was saying this embodied thing, the way I was thinking about it was really that.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker A: Skin in the game, right? Quite literally, if something hits my leg, it affects my ability to collect food. Whereas it's not like a loss function. That's actually like, it affects that labeling assignment. So it's like we have this imminent threat to our physical existence - the perception of mortality and finite life. And biological imperatives that drive us to navigate the environment in a very particular way. I think it's those conditions that give rise to internal reflection and self awareness. And a social emulation component - that's a relevant feature of our landscape in both information and energy management. So I think if you could capture those dynamics sufficiently well in a simulated environment, I see no reason why. 

Speaker F: I see the social factor being huge, because we want to protect ourselves. We don't want to experience every experience there is. The ability for humans to learn from others, we don't have to go through everything ourselves. We just have to learn from different people.

Speaker C: Language encapsulates experience and gives it to others. We're creating the first consciousnesses through LLMs entirely based on language, which is secondhand knowledge. But they are conscious almost. There's something to be said about 3D information, which LLMs have no clue about. If you try spatial reasoning with LLMs, they're not good at it. Maybe if they read physics textbooks forever, they'll get intuition. But that happening is much harder than connecting an LLM to computer vision and reinforcement learning. 

Speaker B: That's why we developed eyes before language. Up to 50% of our brain is visual processing. Language compresses information, vision compresses electromagnetic information meaningfully. The human brain combines sensors into an abstract space and processes it. We can get elements there. I wanted to touch your earlier point - we want multimodal embodiment, self-modifying objectives, but not craziness.

You mentioned the paradox enthusiast - I keep coming back to that. There's the no cloning theorem in quantum mechanics - no two states can be identical. If thoughts are chemical reactions represented by quantum mechanics, there's no way to clone that brain state. 

Speaker A: Oh, I see.

Speaker C: So maybe it's impossible.

Speaker B: Yeah, that's why a simulated version of a brain can't replicate the nondeterministic process. The reason we think we have free will is the brain isn't 100% deterministic. Despite chaos theory and lack of control over prior events, the argument for free will is our actions aren't completely predictable. If asked at Starbucks if I want a receipt, my answer yes or no has no rhyme or reason.
 Here is the edited transcript with the filler content removed:

Speaker F: Brains are nondeterministic. 
Speaker B: I think it's a great point because brains are nondeterministic. Like neurons have firing probabilities. That's how we talk about them. So there's going to be different configurations. That's like quantum mechanics - things are probabilistic. So there's going to be different outcomes. They're not going to behave the exact same, which is the point you brought up - if you clone a brain, they're immediately two different entities. So you can't clone yourself, but you can clone something very close that everyone would call a clone, but it wouldn't be you. 
Speaker C: Yeah, maybe I wouldn't go into the Star Trek teleporter.
Speaker B: This relates to the physics AI conversation. Quantum mechanics seems incomplete. Then it could allow exact cloning, we just lack the physics.
Speaker A: This theory with eight dimensions - is it a hidden variables theory saying we think things are stochastic due to an incomplete model, but with another mechanics everything would be deterministic?
Speaker B: Yes, it has similarities with geometric unity. 
Speaker G: That's all I can say.
Speaker A: Consciousness is just a Hamiltonian, a time operator evolving through energy and space.
Speaker B: Just a unitary operator. 
Speaker A: LMS should be her mission.
Speaker B: Our goal is to build AI that creates new physics knowledge.
 Here is the edited transcript:

Speaker B: What's the secret sauce? I mentioned that we have a wet lab in Toronto, right? So we synthesize these TiO2 photocatalysts. These are nanomaterials, nanoparticles ten to 25 nm across, and we dope them with copper, platinum, and that creates this series of photocatalyst reactions that lets you convert CO2, water, and sunlight directly to natural gas. The cool thing is, nobody knows why the base material even does what it does. No one has a clue, really, what's happening at the atomic level - what competing chemical reactions occur. Do X centers show up, for example? What role do they play? So, one arm of our company models and optimizes those systems using neural networks trained on density functional theory and molecular dynamics, plus output from our lab.  
Speaker A: Sounds straightforward.
Speaker H: Very. 
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: If I didn't come here, I would figure it out.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: We're almost at time. I want to have minutes for us to share interesting ideas that stood out. It'll help get over this looping problem with my later vectorization of our conversation. I have some thoughts on this AI salon thing. I think a lot of our conversations, thinking happens through social processing, conversation, which are ephemeral in nature. My goal with this salon thing is because good ideas are born out of conversations, to capture them, make them interactive in the future. Ian leads governance at Credo AI. We have discussions on AI topics, but we're building infrastructure that's more general for any event series to help distill out opinions brought up and then replay that interaction in the future. We're curious to explore software features to make a compelling experience. I'm scooping up your ideas, using them later. My hope is this can become a living body of thoughts, conversations people interact with. This conversation's been around physics of simulated realities, nature of information, simulated thoughts, conscious awareness. I think there's been interesting ideas. AI Salon runs every Sunday. We have small conversations like this and larger events with 100-150 people in discussion groups to reach more people. We have a Slack, I'll invite your emails. If you have topic ideas or want to host, we're open to it. We want to make the salon a protocol, not something I own. Here's how to moderate them, software to add your social intelligence to the Gestalt hive mind.

Speaker F: Are you from Qualia? 

Speaker H: No, just friends with Andreas.

Speaker G: Me too.

Speaker F: Haven't seen him in long time.

Speaker B: Have you not met him before?

Speaker F: No, just haven't seen him. 

Speaker G: A really long time.

Speaker B: And you haven't met Ahmed before?

Speaker A: Twitter.

Speaker F: Your social.

Speaker H: Yeah. I feel weird introducing myself. 

Speaker F: I like your shit every day.

Speaker B: I'm Simone. Nice to meet you.

Speaker G: Nice to meet you. 

Speaker A: Love to see this happen.

Speaker G: New to Twitter. What the fuck?
 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript focusing on removing fluff and filler while retaining the key substantive content:

Speaker A: Okay. We can go around the circle if you want.

Speaker B: Sure. Let's go this way.

Speaker H: I thought your thoughts on embodiment were interesting. I also thought what you said about language was fascinating. Rune mentions text as the universal interface. A friend said language was the universal interface. But text is an abstraction of language which approximates qualia. At its core, language approximates our physical environment. We're communicating spatially experienced things. So for embodied AI, I don't think text or language are sufficient for communicating everything in a spatial environment. They have to process spatial information using electromagnetic fields. Computing qualia is core to consciousness and experience. Current systems will understand a lot through text and language but aren't good at spatial reasoning. We can feed them more spatial data and they'll improve, but processing won't be efficient until they actually process the information. Qualia is necessary for experience. 

Speaker B: We have questions about consciousness. The hard problem questions its nature. Our model of reality constantly improves but never seems complete. So what does that imply for understanding consciousness? We'll have a model we keep improving but as conscious entities asking about ourselves, there may be no meaningful way to answer.  

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker B: Overall, great conversation. Nice to meet some of you again.

Speaker A: Can we get a 140 character takeaway?

Speaker E: The only takeaway is cloning and teleportation not happening. 

Speaker B: Interesting takeaway is we still don't fully understand meaning and knowledge. We lack definitions for what it means to truly know something. Until we know that, we can't know AGI's limitations in answering fundamental questions. Very interested in that. Enjoyed the discussion.

Speaker F: Consciousness wasn't something I thought of before. This conversation allowed me to think more about it. I would have argued 100% we'd be the same person after cloning/teleportation, but now more like 90%.

Speaker B: Yeah.

Speaker A: All right. Thanks for coming out.
 Here is an edited version of the transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker F: The continuity problems are interesting already with split brain patients who are human. If you can make it so the left brain has to explain something it didn't witness, it will explain it and give this past history, and it perceives itself as a continuing consciousness. Functionally, maybe that means it is like, does it really matter? If we can simulate enough of the human brain, even if it's just the electrical plus some chemical components, and get it to high enough accuracy, I might say, sure, clone my consciousness. Meaning if you can create that level of similarity by cloning mechanistic aspects of my brain, I might allow that AI, and say it's similar enough to call it a clone, especially if you're not going to kill me afterwards. The social thing we talked about was highly interesting, like, the observer effect in a social context. If society observes something, does that change? Thinking probabilistically allowed us to understand more of the world - at a social level, that's really interesting.

Speaker G: I'm fascinated to see groups having a resurgence in thinking about consciousness and physics. With EAC, there's a confluence bringing together people with the same interests. I'm really glad I came back to San Francisco. 

Speaker B: You've reminded me to write a rebuttal to Straussen's physicalist panpsychism. It was interesting to see an advisor I saw as skeptical become adamant about theories of consciousness. Like any good philosopher, I don't believe anything until I'm ready to write a book about it. So he must believe it to some extent. The only way to get them to elaborate is to challenge their ideas. Open to suggestions on lines of inquiry to attack Straussen's ideas.

Speaker D: I learned a lot, but conclude consciousness is a collective process. That makes me think AGI might not be achievable unless you invite it to the collective process. You probably can never do that.  

Speaker B: Interesting take. You don't think AGI might be conscious unless we allow it to exist within a natural collective process?
 Here is the edited conversation without filler content:

Speaker D: Regarding the embodiment, the reason to give an AGI a body is to make it similar and safe.

Speaker C: I loved the teleportation discussion and now feel I'd be okay changing parts of my brain, but not completely destroying and recreating it. How much could you change before it’s no longer you? I’m interested in simulating realities - what rules govern them? We have simulations like video games within video games. 

Speaker A: I have a degree in sociology and anthropology.

Speaker C: My family is from Venezuela near the Yanomami people. I’m planning an expedition there to understand their relationship to technology. Any ideas on what I could show or ask them? I considered VR but that may be too much.  

Speaker B: A holographic display may be better than VR to avoid overwhelming them. They can understand 3D images, but being transported to another unfamiliar world could be traumatic without knowing the underlying technology.

Speaker C: Their models of reality are different, so it could provide insights, but I want to minimize negative impacts.  

Speaker B: Start with something exotic but not fully immersive or sensory-overwhelming.

Speaker A: We should think about the best way to interact with uncontacted Amazonians respectfully.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation with filler content removed:

Speaker A: One of the first things you learn in anthropology is the history of anthropology and the history of crime directive. I'll share some anthropological insight. The history of anthropology is pretty much the history of colonial explorers going to uncontacted tribes and showing them shiny things. There's a lot of debate in the field. It's pretty resoundingly determined that was actually not a good thing to do because of the ethical considerations involved. I appreciate the mindset of, let's show them a VR headset, bro. But really think about that and think about the ethics involved and whether it's fully consensual from both sides in terms of what they're getting involved with. Also your own mindset in terms of approaching those conversations and acknowledging and respect and dignity of other people, and that they are not actually a science experiment for your own curiosity. That's a big takeaway from anthropology, to learn and read about that in terms of getting ethics approval for research involving vulnerable people or whether they actually have informed consent. Something to think about in your travels. 
Speaker F: I already signed up for that.
Speaker A: Hell, yes. 
Speaker G: Right there.
Speaker A: So bring your love of jet fighters and everything else, lasers, and we'll talk about the kill chain. We all love conscious awareness, but how can we take it away?


#2023-11-01 AI Salon x GAICO - Stephen Campbell
---------------------------

Names have been changed to preserve anonymity.

 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: We're live. Let's do it.
Speaker B: I wanted to bring up a point about education. I classify two kinds - learned from experiences versus resources. So how does AI affect learning from experiences? That's often harder to obtain. Can great teaching be an experience? I think it is. But it's said the world is the best teacher - things humans can't teach.  

Speaker A: You're distinguishing between tactile skills and book knowledge. AI impacts learning by doing, like direct marketing - no professor teaches that. So both one-on-one tutoring and classroom learning matter for creativity and innovation.

Speaker C: With hardware, machines can see infrared and ultraviolet - not our spectrum. So there are implications in art too. Intentionally developing human-level AI could be a better partner than superhuman AI.  

Speaker D: My AI startup creates human-biased AI.

Speaker A: Interesting point on AI biases and creativity.

Speaker C: What's worth learning in the age of generative AI? Before, you'd need a physics PhD to contribute to fusion. But now you could just query agents trained on textbooks and get multimodal feedback as you build. So what's worth learning or doing for creativity?

Speaker A: Humanity in innovation is key.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: I think that's a really interesting point. This guy I met at university never coded in his life. He coded a little bit. I've been coding since I was twelve, so I've become a really good coder. In the space of three months, using Chat GPT, this guy was writing better programs that I've ever written just by prompting GPT really, really well and making this meticulously crafted prompt. I realized this guy just outpaced me in three months. 

Speaker A: Was he able to scope down problems and create different functions or parts of the algorithm? Or was it like architecting? There's a larger meta.

Speaker C: Honestly, I think it's a bit of a pride thing. I think programmers take a lot of pride in your code and you never want to look up how to do something. You want to code it all yourself. Whereas with Chat GPT you wouldn't mind just asking it to write everything out quickly. I think the skill worth learning is learning how to work with GPT because then you can move much faster.

Speaker B: I would want to teach my child how to work with these AI systems.

Speaker C: With these AI systems.

Speaker D: Can I ask - would you think that same dynamic applies to painting or photography? 

Speaker A: Did you guys see that in the back? Can you repeat the question?

Speaker D: That dynamic they just described, would you think that applies to painting, photography, music?

Speaker C: Not yet. With vision GPT and multimodal models coming, imagine chat GPT on your camera. You could ask to capture the most captivating moment and it could guide your hardware. So eventually you'll have on device guidance. From a photographer standpoint, part of gaining skill is repetition - number of photos taken and shared - that could be condensed into just capturing the moment.

Speaker D: When I'm painting and I like what turned out, I am shut off from technology. I struggle to interact with AI.

Speaker A: It depends on the feedback. Feedback is valuable to build skill by figuring out if you're doing the right thing. But once you have the skill set, you're just applying it. 

Speaker C: You could give the AI different personalities - an assistant, a critique personality trained on more data than one professor over many years and students and genres. Give it an objective function - I want to present at a professional gallery. It's doing what an art teacher would, just with more data.

Speaker D: That's what we're building - synthetic responses. Just not close yet. 

Speaker A: I'm curious how to imagine the AI's role.

Speaker C: Seems pretty clear - like a virtual critic.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker D: I think more philosophical debate that we have at where I work and I have with other artists sometimes, is, does AI have to be able to build a nation to be truly human, or to even be like, a superhuman AI? There are so many ethical considerations around intentionally creating an AI that, because I feel like a missing piece of the puzzle when you think about AI and art is the emotional reaction to an art piece is so integral to what we're doing.  

Speaker B: So is AI going to have the...

Speaker A: Would it be beneficial to separate into two smaller groups of five or six?

Speaker C: Yeah, that works better. 

Speaker A: We could also take, like, an intermission at some point too, I'm sure. We have enough chairs here. We could form these chairs on a group. Let's divide it in the middle. 

Speaker A: Let's migrate over here. All right, you come with us. You come with us.  

Speaker A: It's fairly unacoustically optimized.

Speaker D: Sorry.

Speaker A: Like, shut up. Wait, who was recording?

Speaker C: Is it you?

Speaker A: Yeah, I'm still recording. Here we go. Let me get this signed. Nine A and nine B. All right.

Speaker C: It's similar, the icebreaker, being outdoors. I climbed up a hill today. It was really... 

Speaker A: Did you mission up in mission?

Speaker C: Yeah. Mission Peak.

Speaker A: Should we do a little round of introduction? I was going to say I showed...

Speaker C: Up a little late here, by the way. 

Speaker A: Oh, my goodness. That is just incredible.

Speaker C: Yeah. Really, really good. Never seen anything like it before. Nice.

Speaker A: Well, yeah, let's do, like, a quick round of intros and then get back into it. You want to start us off, Brandon?

Speaker C: I'm Brandon. Nice to meet you. I'm staying at 24th Street Mission. I'm only here for three months on Esther, my co founder, and I were trying to raise out here. And if that goes well, then we'll get a visa. We'll stay here for long. We're working on trying to make the world's best teacher to turn your kids into the generation's next.

Speaker A: And you and Sherry are...

Speaker D: Sherry? Yes, Sherry. I'm a photographer, actually. Photographer. So creative aspect of it. And talking about the sky earlier, the great view of Jeff was magnificent, wasn't it?

Speaker C: Yes. Magical.

Speaker D: Creative world is going to go so I can follow it and roll with it instead of not important.

Speaker C: I'm Joshua. I'm here studying engineering management. Has a background, computer engineering. Generally interested in the hardware, but here with AI kind of connects to. Since I kind of continue to use it for ever more things in my day to day, I'm kind of wondering on also talking with the photography where to balance basically being authentic and human and building real results and kind of. I'm much more sympathizing with the view of seeing AI as a tool. Contrary to kind of completely merging it and striking the balance between fine tuning, let's say, language models, but still kind of where is. How do we navigate being authentic human while leveraging the powers of AI. And using that power.

Speaker A: Where did you say you were?

Speaker C: Southea Itu University.

Speaker D: Hi, everyone. My name is Devanshu Brahmbat. I'm doing my master's in University of Texas, but I'm also doing my thesis in the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. So I'm staying in Berkeley, and I'm doing my thesis there.

Speaker A: What's your thesis on?

Speaker B: My thesis is on the data storage and visualization platform for quantum computers. I'm into that. And recently I founded a company called PaperToCL, where we are aiming to explain research paper using AI power generate explanation. So our goal is to anyone on the planet Earth, you can easily find the research, understand the research, and apply the research in the real world. And that's the thing I'm doing.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: I'm Pierce. I co-founded the Gen AI Collective. I'm in a restaurant, FPV, from Series A, Series B. My whole life revolves around AI. My interests really lie in how AI can augment exponentially more complex systems we've built - whether it's software using code generation or drug discovery or social connection. 

Speaker B: I'm Stephen with the collective as well. I have a startup called Revamp doing marketing automation with AI. It's been interesting to see how quickly people can learn new skills through AI.

Speaker D: I'm Susanna, co-founder of Subconscious where we create well-designed experiments and synthetic respondents representing humans, not superhumans. There are applications like predicting the voting preferences of non-voters. I'm also an artist at Lucid Dreamwalls. I find the intersection of AI and art interesting as a traditional oil painter.

Speaker A: Have you played with Midjourney? 

Speaker D: Some of my friends do AI art. My art is traditional in media, not subject.

Speaker B: I think imagination and creativity are coupled. AI is great for learning but can restrict imagination because I can instantly get anything like a poem from GPT. Can we use AI to increase rather than restrict imagination?

Speaker D: I have friends who weren't artists but now call themselves that after using AI. It took me years to become an artist. But they're contributing to the arts community, getting people involved, so it's good more people are creative even if it hurts my pride. Their art has improved. 

Speaker C: Are they an artist or just a prompt engineer?

Speaker A: Every major technological shift lowers barriers to entry. It seems odd at first but people learn over time.

Speaker D: Their art has improved, but...

Speaker C: Are they an artist or just a prompt engineer?

Speaker A: Good question.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation with the filler content removed:

Speaker D: With this context, I'm more comfortable calling them an artist, not because of the quality of their art, but because they've used it to put resources into putting on shows, getting more people involved in the art world. The shows they put on are incredibly well done, and that is their artwork. Lowering barriers to entry is always good. I could see AI making it easy for someone to do art who never had the opportunity before. It turns out they're a great artist. 

Speaker A: What do you think? Part of what I took from your pitch is finding hidden talent.

Speaker C: I'm not an artist, so I can't say much, but with paintings you don't need to paint nowadays. You could use a tablet. But people still paint, and there's value in that. Part of what makes art good is you spend a long time on it, although that's not entirely true. 

Speaker D: I don't disagree. Another thing that makes art good is you put so much personal information into it. AI doesn't have that experience yet. 3D art is interesting, but I love paintings. After studying Van Gogh, seeing them in person, you can feel the thick brushstrokes, the emotion and thickness of the paint. AI might recreate the look, but not the feeling. 

Speaker C: In person.

Speaker D: There's a study showing when people see the texture in a painting, they recreate the painter making it in their heads. That generates emotional reactions. I learned this when I met a woman who started an AI company using robots trained to create large scale paintings collaborating with artists, so more people can afford semi-original works. It retains the human element of the art process and textures you can't get in AI. 

Speaker C: What's the name?

Speaker D: Acrylic robotics. The robot mimics the painter's style. 

Speaker B: The robot mimics the paint strokes.  

Speaker D: I want to try it as an artist to put in the technical inputs. 

Speaker A: Good question.

Speaker D: Right now they use Adobe InDesign and a tablet to mimic you. Another coming up will have cameras so you're not constrained to one medium. Right now just acrylic. But for other mediums it will be more complicated, like oil painting. I'm definitely going to try that.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Speaker C: With art photography, delivering something authentic is most helpful. Painting and oil takes a lot of nuance and experience. In early stages of learning skills, there's a lot of tricks, like with perspective, that without guidance, take a lot of trial and error. I feel technology and tools can fast pace learning these skills, not by just generating and replicating style, but by better learning the skill itself. That connects to your theme - it's still a medium if you want to keep it authentic. How can we use guidance and tools to actually train us to be better?

Speaker D: I learned in group settings with other artists. You would learn almost as much from the other artists for a number of reasons. I had art teachers that influenced me greatly, but that didn't happen in isolation. 

Speaker C: With art, there isn't really a right or wrong. If you have a tutor trying to teach kids modular arithmetic in a Socratic way, and a bright kid explains it first, that spoils it for the other kids because they didn't discover it themselves. When you figure it out on your own, that intuition is stronger than just hearing someone else explain it. I think that's different with knowledge-based things that have right and wrong answers.

Speaker A: How did we get on that? 

Speaker C: We're talking about art. She said you learn just as much from others as your tutor. I argued that's true with art, but with science and other objective topics, it's better to have a one-on-one tutor so others don't spoil the answer. 

Speaker A: Do you think this applies to other fields as well?

Speaker D: An interesting field between art and science is politics and debating, where there aren't always right answers. 

Speaker C: I don't like politics, it always seems a massive mess. 

Speaker D: But learning history and politics while growing up is valuable. 

Speaker C: Yes, just taking it as an example.

Speaker A: Carry on the discussion.

Speaker B: The new education has to be AI compatible - the proportion of machine learning exposure at certain ages. If a smarter student gives me all the answers I'm looking for, I'll never explore apart from that question. I only see what's directly presented, not other approaches. Doing trial and error myself, I get experience and learn techniques to find answers if somebody's not there to help. Education should expose students to more AI as they advance in age.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker D: I think there's a place for creativity and science.

Speaker C: You just need a better prompt. The standard GPT is super clinical. But if you change the prompt well enough and guide it in a certain direction, then it's a lot better. 

Speaker D: Let's go down the rabbit hole and see.

Speaker B: Can AI be my co-founder?

Speaker D: That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying, can AI be like my co-scientist?

Speaker C: You invest in me as co-founder, 50% equity. 

Speaker D: Is it really interesting legally?

Speaker A: That could be a clever way to keep your cat accountable.

Speaker D: I used to be a lawyer.

Speaker B: The time will come that AI can have emotions and human instincts. Then it can be a co-founder. 

Speaker C: Humans can handle higher complexities than current AI.

Speaker A: This is similar to previous paradigm shifts like the internet and mobile. No one could have predicted the novel creations those enabled. AI will do the same, producing more and better art even if aided by prompting. 

Speaker B: Interesting to me. 

Speaker D: I fundamentally disagree with that analysis.

Speaker A: Okay, I'm glad you do.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker D: Increased complexity in AI does not make art improve. Are AI artists sitting there thinking about memories when they were five years old? Of course not. The AI piece might have weird complexity but it wouldn't have the emotion you see in art from 1000 years ago.

Speaker A: So it's the iterative process. 

Speaker D: It's moving at a human speed that allows unlocking of memory and emotion. Maybe there needs to be a different name for it. I feel like artists who create by hand is different than AI art. AI doesn't have that emotion I'm talking about. 

Speaker B: But they...

Speaker D: I categorize it this way - art that intentionally involves slow hands on process. Their art involves a computer but also hand carved wood pieces connected to it. 

Speaker A: When Photoshop came out, people said Photoshop artists weren't real artists. Today we'd consider them artists. Where do you draw the line between Photoshop artist and AI artist?

Speaker D: I'm not saying AI can't be an artist. I think AI would have to feel emotion in some sense to be a human artist. I just think AI art is not the same.

Speaker A: Being a better programmer doesn't necessarily make you a better artist, that makes sense.

Speaker C: Have you tried replicating your art with AI? How do you feel about that? I use AI to increase productivity - for emails, reports, etc. The end result is better sometimes. But I have to refine it - remove over the top phrases, generic stuff. It's an iterative process but faster with AI. But would I have written that? It makes me wonder if people can tell I didn't write it myself. 

Speaker D: It's easy to tell with intern applications which ones used AI.

Speaker C: We have assignments using AI to become literate with it. That makes sense to have the positive without the negative. But people notice it. How do you navigate this?
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker D: AI has its own voice. Using AI makes that voice standardized, like taking on a voice that's not yours. There is a way to make AI allow us to keep our individual voices, understand each other better, speed up communication within community and as individuals. There is a deeply human dream of people from different backgrounds and languages communicating seamlessly. AI can accelerate that. But there's a vision where AI takes over diverse languages. Ideally AI is a conduit for human energy and diversity, not merging in a way that doesn't retain wonder. 

I have a burning question - what's real anymore in creativity and journalism? Because AI can create anything, make it look realistic. So what do we believe? Where do we find truth? Where are AIs learning from each other? What's the source? What pictures of war are real? 

Speaker A: That's a great question.

Speaker D: Is there a way to ethically...?

Speaker B: There are two discussions we can draw from that. One - what is real? We can manipulate reality with apps. We can change pictures - that's one issue. And what if AI learns from itself, how far can it go? I think both are concerning questions. The second is more that if AI starts learning from itself and we lose control, it's fine till we have control. But if we lose control and AI surpasses human intelligence, we have a real problem because we built something more evolved that can trick us without us realizing. So control of AI should be there initially until we fully understand how far it can go. Then we can develop software to identify if something is AI generated - that could be a solution. 

Speaker D: Would there need to be a watermark or something legally for everything created by AI?

Speaker C: OpenAI and others signed something recently about making a digital watermark. But some say it's another way for them to control the whole system - they watermark everything so it's known they created it. For a long time Sam Altman said we need legislation and restrictions on AI - none of you should make AI, it's important we control it. So some think that before GP4 he purposefully acted worried about releasing it, but wanted to be the big dogs controlling it all along. And with the watermarks it's another way for them to control the system.

Speaker B: It's technologically really hard to detect what's from GPT versus human written. Some argue you can distinguish between human and AI writing, but eventually there may not be patterns you can identify.

Speaker D: I was thinking of a watermark from the creator to identify it's AI, not as a control thing.

Speaker C: Yeah exactly.
 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: A friend trained a language model on her journal to have her authentic writing style. The more data you feed it of your previous work, the more authentic future generated work. 

Speaker D: You can fine tune it because it learns from my songs. How do you input?

Speaker C: You can fine tune a model with openAI APIs. People have smaller models to fine tune too. 

Speaker D: Her personal software?

Speaker C: Was it with llama or Facebook's model you can run locally? Llama is what Facebook has - Laura, based on his sister. Fine tune the model. She fine tuned her journal to write like her.

Speaker A: Sorry.

Names have been changed to preserve anonymity.

 Here is the edited transcript with filler content Hannahed:

Speaker A: Been thinking about the social impact of this, in different verticals and social problems. 

Speaker B: Love to hear. I've been to that talk yesterday with the ZaraitHub CEO. 

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker B: Yeah. I saw the demo for Nvidia.

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker C: I record these conversations to transcribe and share the actual conversation here. I will anonymize names, but there are rules of engagement like Chatham House rules - you can talk outside of here about what is discussed, but not who discusses them. 

Speaker D: Of Chatham House, right? 

Speaker C: Yes, totally. But there's a recording going on, so I want you to be aware of that.

Speaker E: How would we like to open the circle up more so we can all see each other? Or keep the table setup?

Speaker C: I'm going to keep us here. Thank you for bringing perspectives here. I've heard themes like predictability versus empiricism with guardrails. Before specific guardrails, I want us to surface assumptions about timelines we care about. One perspective is safeguarding. Another is can we predict the future well enough to create effective policies? Or must we take an empirical approach? These are fundamental. So I want to start there - how predictable do we think AI evolution and policy effects actually are?

Speaker D: We can turn to the past - did we predict where we are now? My opinion - yes, scaling laws were out there for years. Attention is what you need. Some papers made it clear we'd start computing these things. The pattern was established. From ZaraPT-3 we knew Kwame would be exceptional. Not everything can be predicted, but some things can. We can extrapolate towards the future - what can we expect from systems like Zaraemini and others in terms of market-making and industrial choices?
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content Hannahed:

Speaker C: So I'll try and define phrases people aren't aware of. Zaraemini is a system Zaraoogle is developing to connect large language models OpenAI has pushed with DeepMind's reinforcement learning approaches for AlphaZarao. We expect it to be more agentic and unpredictable than scaling laws. Scaling laws is a thesis OpenAI has pushed since 2016 - this predictability works, so San Francisco is hopping now because investors can be assured returns. 

Speaker D: Except emergent capacities. These models are black boxes. We started to understand capabilities on the fringes could only be materialized by testing. There's a duality between what's predictable and what's not. Is this inerrant or revealed by using the system? 

Speaker C: The same paper notes predictability but emergent capabilities. They may exist but be hard to extract without the right prompt. Either way, we don't see some capabilities that sometimes emerge unexpectedly. In existential risk, concerning capabilities are self-propagation or deception. This is an analogy.

Speaker E: Because.

Speaker C: I sometimes hear people less bullish on predictability point to analogies like the Industrial Revolution - too much regulation will stop innovation, so we have to keep guardrails off because we don't know where this will go. Does anyone represent that perspective here?
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff Hannahed:

Speaker F: One challenge is fixating on predictable things and creating rules around those while unpredictable or spontaneous things happen that weren't accounted for. We might create guardrails around certain LLMs but miss other things that cause overreaction. We need to find the right way to describe what's predictable vs not, and normal surprises.   

Speaker C: If Kwame was frozen, society would still evolve and figure out new uses, encoding itself and transforming industries in various ways over time. The technology itself is evolving too in capacity. The intersection of static tech and evolving society might be hard to predict. We can predict models' capabilities somewhat.

Speaker F: You're bringing up challenges in predictability. We might fixate on predictable things, create guardrails, yet unpredictable mutations still occur, scaring people. Like with nuclear power - we created guardrails but missed things that caused overreaction. We need to properly describe predictable vs not to avoid repeating this.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content Hannahed:

Speaker Zara: I think there's two types of Zaraodrails we suck at, right? The short term Zaraod Rails, which we see all the time with my product. It's an engineering problem and we need to fix it. And then there's the long term guardrails, like the existential risk guardrails, which is more a policy conversation before it's even a technical conversation, right? I think you're making an excellent point that we may risk killing the good that lays the golden eggs by prematurely imposing guardrails. And certainly that's been the trend of technological innovation over the last few decades, which has led to the secular stagnation and all of that stuff. I used to work at Uber, so not a huge fan of regulation. But this time I would say we need serious, serious, serious policy guardrails in place even before we know what's going to happen. Because we can't wait to see what's going to happen.

Speaker E: Something in the waddle there.

Speaker Zara: But hello super. You know, I think we are talking about existential risk. I think the case for existential risk is actually quite convincing. Namely, we can't really predict exactly what's going to happen, but we can predict the outline of what's going to happen. Namely, any sufficiently intelligent agent ends up pursuing three things. It ends up pursuing whatever you're good. If you are an intelligent agent, you are going to pursue three things. Number one, you don't want to die. Number two, you want a ton of resources. Number three, you don't want anyone to change your goal. Right? That's called instrumental. That's super dangerous, right? Because if we have like an EZaraI that's way more powerful and intelligent than us, then it will not want us to kill it and it won't want us to change its goals and it will want to accumulate as many resources as possible and maybe cover the entire earth with solar panels in. This is actually one of the topics. Well, I would actually for once make an exception. Be like, yeah, we need serious, serious, serious policy guardrails in place even before we know what's going to happen. Because we can't wait to see what's going to happen.

Speaker C: I'm going to intercede here for 1 second to say two things. One, can you introduce yourself? 

Speaker H: Yes. Hi. I'm Zara. I'm so sorry I'm late. What are we doing as part of the introduction?

Speaker C: We are just letting people know what brought you to this theme. Like why are you interested in Zarauardrails?

Speaker H: Awesome. Yeah. So I am working with McKinsey and a lot of my work has been helping companies thinking through their AI strategy. And more recently with Joshua, I've been speaking with more retail and law clients on like, okay, how do we set our responsible AI principles? And that has been interesting for me because I've had academic sort of learning, but also seeing how companies are, what discussions they're having in the room when they're thinking about implementing it. And I thought this would be a great opportunity to really meet people from across the board and get their perspective on the topic.

Speaker C: Awesome. Second thing, the bathroom is down the hall on the left. Okay. And there's also glasses over there if you would like water. 

Speaker E: And Chatham House rules.

Speaker C: We are recording this conversation. We're following Chatham House rules. So you're free to talk about what we talk about here. I might even publish what we talk about here. But no one specifically will be named or attribution will likely be given.
 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content Hannahed:

Speaker B: The proposed AI act in the EU has had a lot of discussion. For non high risk AI, there's a self governance recommendation. For high risk AI, they're figuring out where general purpose AI and large language models fit. They're discussing pre market requirements or foreseeability - predicting things that might go wrong beforehand and fixing or mitigating them if too high risk. Question one - what falls into foreseeable scope? Can we foresee existential risks or just proximate ones? Maybe existential risks seem too attenuated or we don't consider them. This is an open question in the EU act that's important even for the US. Like ZaraDPR, if interacting with the EU market, you need this trustworthy certification. So these rules and regulations should happen, but will risk assessment be constructive or just more process? 

Speaker C: Yeah, Natalia, please.

Speaker E: A couple emerging threads to clarify. There's engineering capabilities with more known practices and guardrails. And socially emergent complexities, much more unknown. I'll make up a term - when pace of capabilities outstrips market saturation of those capabilities at a fixed point, it develops a "frontier ecosystem". The number of new opportunities is greater than seekers. Like early internet. Regarding guardrails, two lessons from nuclear energy - engineering controls built into tech, and social controls built into laws. In a frontier ecosystem, social controls via case law can't keep up with exploding possibilities. But engineering controls follow a more known improvement curve based on infrastructure and capitalism. These ideas make sense?
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content Hannahed:

```Speaker C: They resonate. Connects with professor at Stanford, Sarah, who articulates Natalia's talking about. His thing is AI practitioners have to develop a culture of responsibility because any law, any standard has proximal effect, which is what explicitly regulates. But hopefully engenders broader culture of responsibility, which is more robust change. Issue is AI born out of tech culture or co-opted by tech culture. Tech culture is uber innovation first mindset. Sometimes points to culture of safety, gap between that and where we are now. I like point calling out through either law or culture there's more uncertainty on social safeguards and evolution. Idea of opportunities outstripping opportunity seekers interesting one. Technical or engineering safeguards sound engineering. 

Speaker E: My pitch is want net effect of guardrails to preserve frontier ecosystem of capabilities and opportunities. But then true point resonated, which is few bad publicity events in social space can hamstring industry, clamp down on that improvement in capability.

Speaker C: Friend believes in AI's capabilities, benefit for humanity. Wants that to pay out in five to ten to 20 years, not long termism. Worried few terrible near misses or bad publicity will lead to complete rejection of technologies. Already seen this with facial recognition - paper showed bias, regardless of dual use. Instead demonized technology. That's pro innovation, pro governance perspective - don't want that backlash. 

Speaker H: If you're developer, can't you put in policy or systems as building to submit potential harms to us? 

Speaker C: They do - OpenAI, DeepMind invest in evaluations, guardrails, governance. Potentially not enough, don't want dictated by builders. Might want more democratized approach. But they invest in evaluating, finding unknowns.
```

The key points and flow are retained while Hannahing filler words, redundant phrases, tangents, and excessive dialog. Let me know if you would like me to edit any other transcripts in this manner.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content Hannahed:

Speaker Zara: I think the tricky part here isn't the Zaraoogles and OpenAIs, which are actually very well intentioned. It is the fact, and Marcus and Elizabeth talk about that it's Mosla. The march of technological history is not on our side here. It is becoming exponentially cheaper and even faster than Mosla to train these models such that a ZaraPT-3, that cost of the order of, call it $100 to $200 million to train three years ago, because today probably of the order of a million dollars, if that, it's really not that much money. And five years from now you're going to be able to train a ZaraPT-3 with perhaps $10,000, right? I think you're actually going to get these things to run on your Apple Watch, right? The case to be made against regulation is kind of reminiscent of the case to be made against gun regulation. But this time it's actually a good case. It's like, if you're regulated, only the bad guys are going to have access to these capabilities, right? Because the OpenAIs and Microsofts are going to kneecap these guys and really make their research slow down to a crawl. But any script kid or terrorist, any ill intentioned person will be able to train these models, whether you want it or not, with a laptop. And there's no way you can regulate that without regulating laptops out of existence. That doesn't mean we can't do it, but that just means insofar as we want to regulate these things, that is the cost. If you really believe there is an existential risk, the cost is like, moratorium on AI effectively. 

Speaker D: I don't believe that in three years from now you're going to be able to train a large language model on a laptop, you're going to be able to run inferences and fine tune, which is very high potential. I agree what you said in terms of the downstream, we've been very active on the AI Act. I really encourage you to read Article 20B of the current text, voted by the European Parliament because it serves as the point of encounter. This is the article focusing on the guardrails for foundation models. It's been a tough fight to get this in. This is now voted and now we have entered into a trilogy. This and the code of conduct been developed by the AI Council between the US and the EU. I think revolving around Article 20B serves as an interesting point to look at in terms of what could be a balance between proactionary and precautionary in terms of common sense, pre market deployment and post market development deployments. Things to watch and look at, because when you look at it, I really encourage you to read the text. I can share it with you and you can share it. I believe this common sense because that's the kind of thing that OpenAI and others are already doing, but without accountability and without necessarily the right amount of investments inside the company and towards its customers and suppliers around that. But for us to be able to calibrate those points of friction and not over regulate to engender a good balance visa vis innovation is to understand the value chain. And right now we don't have a good base of evidence over what is the LLM value chain. What is it? It's not clear. And the more time we spend not having it through science, through policy, the more we are bound to make mistakes. The value chain thing is for us like an important flashpoint.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Speaker C: I wanted to make sure everyone's on the same page about the UA act. It approaches regulation by saying there are high risk systems and not high risk - high risk being systems closer to human flourishing like healthcare and jobs. These have additional requirements like transparency on evaluations and training data. There was a gap for generative AI systems within these high risks we're discussing, but conversations have evolved to include general purpose AI system regulation.

Speaker B: Is any research being done on the value chains? 

Speaker D: There are elements consolidated at the OECD level, but it's still quite shallow because it's moving so fast. That's why we proposed framing governance to include research and development - governing the potent, complex technoscientific cocktail.

Speaker B: The EU AI Act proposes regulatory sandboxes. Each member state can have their own, so I wonder how efficient oversight will be. It's rare for a system to be for just one country, so different laws are difficult. California may model the AI Act for the US. We might see military or existential threat policies federally, but few frameworks proposed so far. That's why I push discussions on the EU AI Act.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content Hannahed:

Speaker C: We've moved into this policy discussion to bring it back to how it intersects with predictability and surprise. It's a recognition that this technology is developing so quickly that policymakers do not want to create brittle policy. They want something that can adapt and evolve. That seems fundamentally difficult. The technology of governance itself needs to evolve to be able to maintain because this needs to be both precautionary and reactive. There are certain risks we can anticipate some common sense things - track certain information which will allow us to better act in the future, record AI incidents, do some compute governance and understand who is training large frontier models. These seem like sensible systems to set us up better. But it seems fundamentally difficult to create this meta system to react appropriately over time.

Speaker A: I had a question on the EUA Act and what you mentioned - the gaps that policy tends to create. Is there an initial consensus around what's missing in the EUA Act in terms of guardrails? 

Speaker B: Foundational models, right? That's something.

Speaker D: It's addressed through 28 B. A lot of constitutional enforcement is needed to have the right level of coordination across the EU with the CI office, which is now predicted in a non-regulatory way but coordinates EVAs regulatory sandbox and others. How do we calibrate if we put a threshold? Because a key notion is the question of definition. The definition drives the friction point. This question of definition is not solved at all. Expect some interesting surprises across these. These are elements still in flux.

Speaker I: Does the EU act define what is I risk?

Speaker D: Of course one of the best things is to define risk by application layers. That's one of the strongest parts. One of the weakest parts is the underlying technological definition where we don't want to regulate technology or define it. And yet we have problems with XYZ, right? 

Speaker I: So high risk is just specific sectors/applications?

Speaker B: There are annexes that will make it very clear which ones are high risk. Lawyers here will ask - is this high risk? Is it prohibited? Making that call can be difficult if these definitions aren't clear. For things not high risk, there is still a strong recommendation to have self-governance, a code of conduct. Article 69 recommends non-high risk AI have a self-governance program. But there's not much there. 

Speaker A: There are some examples of codes of conduct.

Speaker B: I think some groups are working on that. But if there's no code of conduct, I worry folks will start saying they might be considered high risk and do what is required under high risk AI or do nothing at all because they just don't know what to do.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content Hannahed:

Speaker C: Let me ask about transparency requirements. One goal is to allow the public to make educated decisions about what products they use,  demonize certain things. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, that kind of thing. Are people bullish on transparency?

Speaker F: With the social web, the Facebook platform was documented and the API was out there. There was transparency on how to interact with the system. Maybe you didn't know what was happening behind the scenes with the ad platform or newsfeed optimization. But there was a lot of sunlight in the developer documentation. The ability for people to understand what products or tools could be built was obvious, like an app to move your data out of Facebook. But the result was an explosion that caused everyone to fixate on that one thing, destroying the Facebook platform. So transparency only benefits educated people who can evaluate the information. With the deluge of information, unless you're only living to read it all, there's no possibility of ingesting, rationalizing, and discussing changes. I'm concerned there's so much information it's hard to keep track of. 

Speaker H: It's an info dump.

Speaker B: Even laws say you need transparency through a user guide. So first terms of service, then privacy policy, then user guide. It's a burden without education to adapt and change.   

Speaker F: Was there an education campaign around ZaraDPR cookie banners? My question - what mechanism empowers people to self-inform and make decisions?

Speaker C: Are you going to respond directly?

Speaker E: Not directly. Build on that?

Speaker A: Plus one. I completely agree. Transparency is hard to argue against but who does it empower? A lot of calls currently around transparency of components, data, compute, documentation. But who can make use of that?
 Here is the edited version of the conversation with fluff Hannahed:

Speaker C: The weight more interesting.

Speaker A: I have a question about transparency around usage. How are these models being currently used? We still don't understand how they're being commercialized. 

Speaker B: Let me finish.

Speaker E: Segway?

Speaker A: I think there should be a commitment to translate for different audiences. Otherwise the default around transparency is centered around needs of machine learning scientists. I think that can be solved culturally. But transparency around compute use or training data doesn't help the end user.  

Speaker B: If that's the stuff that's going to help the end user. 

Speaker C: I rarely thought of transparency as primarily for the end user. Transparency enables watchdog groups, government agencies or academia to participate. One goal could be taking difficult transparent reports and making them understandable for consumers. I want the information to exist to allow that ecosystem to develop rather than one company doing everything.

Speaker E: Transparency enables attribution and reputational risk for providers. The automotive industry versus nuclear industry illustrates this. Nuclear liability kills the industry by increasing insurance overhead. Automotive companies compete by reputation on safety.

Speaker C: Are you advocating against liability?

Speaker E: Liability crushes an industry because downstream liability is infinite. But transparency and attributional transparency, who did what, opens companies to reputational risk, which is more positive.

Speaker F: Isn't this why Zaraoogle didn't launch their LLM stuff for so long? 

Speaker E: I think reputational risk to Zaraoogle was enormous.

Speaker C: Reputational risk means there is a meaningful court of public opinion.

Speaker E: So if I'm an app company, I'll choose Claude or Chad based on reputation. 

Speaker F: We use D.

Speaker E: I as a consumer, vote with my money for companies like Volvo or Tesla based on reputation.
 Here is the edited version of the transcript:

Speaker H: I wanted to respond to your point on transparency, where you were saying that when we're thinking about transparency for watchdogs and regulators. I think that is a component of transparency. Earlier you made the point that when we start thinking about the value chain and enterprises building an application layer, there has to be transparency. So if I am a bank or retail company, I struggle with understanding what information is not available because they're not AI native. So if I'm going to use ZaraPT Four, and this is what's been disclosed about how it was trained, what's not available for me to ask? I'm not empowered to ask those questions. At some level, when companies think about their own principles or guardrails, there are things you can and cannot do. And sometimes those are clear. But there are things I would not do because of my values. How do I know if this model conflicts with those values? Because you said certain information is available, certain information is not. For instance, if my value is that my team has demographic representation, ZaraPT Four doesn't tell me who was in the room. So I'll have to use it because others do, and if I don't, I'll be left behind. But how do I shape my narrative within the boundaries of transparency? What's not available to me as a question?

Speaker D: The way the Europeans have looked at that and the transatlantic conversation has shaped that is transparency as sharing risk and liabilities in the value chain. At the foundational model creation point, there is capital and knowledge to create transparency and share information so reasonable liability passes down the chain. Before, some companies pushed liability to the market edge, deploying their model but not giving them information to exercise their risk. Transparency apportions risk appropriately for long term innovation. Fines alone are not sufficient but a web of incentives including liability and in some cases criminal liability creates the right incentives along the value chain and puts obligations where they belong. 

Speaker H: When you say value chain, what do you mean?

Speaker D: Well, if ZaraPT Five developer has no liability without receiving information about what's in the system, you cannot expect a small company with no clue how it was developed to carry the liability.
 Here is the edited transcript:

Speaker C: There's a foundation model, then there's maybe fine tuner, fine tuning system, some other system that gets the data for the fine tuning. It's a vast web that comes together. I think your point is that sometimes safeguards have a veil of being solved. For instance, in San Francisco, every company requires another company to be SoC two compliant, which is a cybersecurity standard. That is the high mark of self governance - it's not required by anyone or a standard, but market forces because every company needs cybersecurity require it. I have not yet read a great academic paper that shows how effective Sock Two has been. Has that tick mark checking exercise helped? I imagine to some degree - I'm sure companies are generally more cybersecure thanks to Sock Two. But how quickly does Sock Two evolve? How quickly does it adapt? Do market leaders have any incentive to continue evolving? My hope for transparency is that customer incentives like pass down companies buying another company is a powerful, powerful law.  

Speaker D: That's because it is incentive.

Speaker E: I wanted to clarify for myself - when you say value chain and apportioning risk liability, I was thinking of a car rental example. Someone that rents a car goes on a rampage - is the manufacturer not liable? This is bad use. But if something faulty in the car failed - brakes or something - is it the dealership for selling a faulty part, the car company didn't maintain it properly? But if they follow the maintenance schedule, then it goes to manufacturer. I think there's an example there, but I think what you said earlier is that these things are so black boxed where that thing went wrong, you can't point to the brake pads that failed because the brake pads are weights in some obtuse space that no one understands. So there's transparency in two senses: company operations/intent/procedures is well formed, but where is the factor of safety for this brake pad equivalent in the parameter space of this model? That's not well formed.

Speaker D: That goes to the heart, which is a real question - over transparency over the weights, which is contentious for good and a few bad reasons. That's why I think we need to elevate the conversation to the level of weights, because of the underlying science. The weights are the equivalent to the factor of safety on the elevator cable - when you design an elevator or airplane, you're criminally liable if you make bad engineering decisions, but we don't know what those decisions are.

Speaker B: Some argue the weights are the trade secrets, the source code. 

Speaker C: Of course. Even safety minded people point out some of these are information hazards over evaluations. Some even demonize some risk focused people as hyping their systems by being concerned about the risk. 

Speaker D: We have an epistemic crisis around that question for good reasons, too. It's the first time I hear another layer - not just commercial interest, but now espionage. I'm like, we won't give a weight to the EU office because we're afraid it will be passed on. That's why I think it's contentious.
 Here is the edited version of the transcript with filler content Hannahed:

Speaker C: The idea is where transparency and safety this is also why sometimes safety minded people and open technology people are sometimes divided now, too. Because previously, most people who are, like me, super into open sourcing things, love the idea of an open web, but now also am worried about the reality that you brought up a while ago of what happens when the open source market is barely delayed versus the frontier months and then Alpaca is trained for $600. How do you kind of push on?

Speaker Zara: There's a metal layer of this conversation that we're starting to touch on, which is, to your point, the quality of the conversation. We've lost goodwill in the conversation. Both sides are now attacking the other side's intentions. We don't get to the substance of the conversation. 

Speaker C: Right.

Speaker Zara: Can we just get into the substance of the conversation? Jeff Hinton, who quit Zaraoogle recently and is a very prominent AI researcher who is starting to be himself extremely concerned about the possibilities of this technology. He said there's two questions that the research community needs to come to a consensus about because the research community itself right now is split on this line. And if the research community is confused, what are the odds the regulator wouldn't understand anything like the researchers themselves don't understand? 

Speaker C: Right.

Speaker Zara: There is a building need for consensus in the research community on two questions. One, is all these large mortgage models actually understanding what they're doing? Or are they just stochastic parrot? And the second question is, what are the risks? Like, exactly? What do we risk? Are the existential risks actually real? 

Speaker D: We're far away from the beauty and the laboring outcome of a scientific consensus. 

Speaker Zara: Definitely. But I think the intuitions of the researchers in that field, because when you talk to these things, it's hard to say there is no understanding going on in these things. I think, again, there is no consensus whatsoever, even in the research community on this. It behooves us at the very least to hold the bar on that conversation where it's like, I don't tolerate whenever I'm in these conversations and people start to attack each other's attention, can we just stay on the substance level of the conversation?
 Here is the edited transcript with the fluff Hannahed:

Speaker C: Attacking intentions sometimes true for large companies becoming pro regulatory, squashes little guy. Regulators deal with that by having triggers where regulation becomes arduous at a certain size. But that's one thing brought up. I agree with you that there are so many substantive reasons to bring up these conversation points that it's troubling when disregarded. I don't see consensus changing for a long time. The only consensus will come if we're on an escrow that flattens out so there's time to gather where we are now. I'm not optimistic we'll get there. I think we'll constantly evolve. We need to act without consensus with lower probabilities, lower certaintude. I think we should try proactive things, innovations then empirically track. I want better incident reporting. I want to know how models are used - that's important information unfortunately we can't protect to protect intellectual property and society's needs. More like companies need to report on system use. 

Speaker D: Additional transparency needed over corporate governance. Important. OpenAI claims nonprofit. Show me proofs. This 501c3 governance made towards transparency. You file 990s saying asset things. Constrained transparency. People lost trust in claims of public versus private because no one understood. I've raised questions to Anthropic too. They promised a wave of corporate governance transparency not yet there. I believe it would help tremendously. But capitalistic race moves us away from desirable corporate governance transparency, key for this hybrid configuration when you claim governance by credo.

Speaker C: Early on, people wanted to work with Credo AI for halo effect, look responsible, good thing - important brand part. But needed actual governance for halo effect.

Speaker E: Does anyone think OpenAI should release weights? 

Speaker D: Wouldn't that be dangerous?

Speaker C: Just ZaraPT 3.5 and 4?

Speaker E: Not to public but government agency?

Speaker H: I feel like that would be dangerous, everyone could access weights then train dangerous models quickly. 

Speaker E: 100%.

Speaker C: Yeah.

Speaker A: Clarifying question - is that what Meta did with Llama?

The key content and speakers are retained, with redundant and filler phrases Hannahed. The main substantive points, questions, and dialogue flow remain intact.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff Hannahed:

Speaker C: Meta released them to researchers and they promptly leaked. Releasing to anyone, what will happen? Llama is a case positive of that. Llama has led to huge numbers of downstream models allowed for different kinds of post training, including reinforcement, learning from human feedback. That has led to greater capabilities and sometimes done very cheaply. 

Speaker Zara: I would default to no, because really it can be very dangerous. 

Speaker D: Safest software is the safest over time.

Speaker C: I can evaluate them, but I'm not looking at the individual floating point values. I'm doing some sort of evaluation and paying for my own hardware, where I can basically do that just by using OpenAI as service. Now I do lose some insight and I can't fine tune things and other downstream things.

Speaker B: Just because you have the weight doesn't mean that you have everything. The weight is just the AI elements. I don't know if you'd be getting the same value, but if you had them on your own, you'd be able to build your own product and maybe adjust the weights a little bit. I think it is an IP issue. When you're working with contractors, it's probably something you should be careful about.  

Speaker C: I sometimes wonder if by releasing the weights we make it very easy to use these systems, to build inference into these systems. Our evaluations are lagging - the kind of safeguards we would want are not easy to do. It's not trivial, it's arduous. And so it takes away from quickly getting going and just setting something out.

Speaker D: One reason why people in my faction want anyone to vote? 

Speaker A: I read something about OpenAI coming out with an Open release. I thought Open and Closed was hard coded into these companies' identities, but it sounds like now OpenAI wants to get into that race because I imagine the Open release will lead to wider penetration and create folks to develop downstream. So I wonder if it's even a philosophical difference or is it even just really based on commercial incentives?

Speaker C: There's a new French company, right? And they are a big time open source, those big more large model in the range of 15 billion parameters. But they like stability. They come out and they say, like, our niche in the ecosystem is to bring these models to you.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff Hannahed:

```Speaker D: Most European stability trying to position themselves versus the Americans by saying we're going to accelerate this, accelerate intake and traction by being open source, which is source of major concern. 
Speaker E: Is that because they're looking to avoid regulatory overhead?
Speaker D: No, mostly because they want to catch up and their sense of how do we create a platform with maximum traction would get from that where we can get our system adopted and red teamed in a way which yields interesting passes in the end. That's why for me, the question of will for people my fashion trying to bridge the gap, I primarily see the need to go at that contentious question as a way to create a wave of scientific research towards mechanistic interpretability and other sources of alignment and control solutions because it remains immensely hard problem scientifically. If you ask entropics interpretability, which is one of the best in the world, how far along they are, you'll see we are so far away. But some others say that no enabling that itself is going to generate more raw capacities. 
Speaker E: But that does open up this question of attribution, of responsibility in the value chain. If you have mechanistic interpretability. Is that true?
Speaker D: Come again?  
Speaker E: When you say mechanistic interpretability, it means we know what parts the model can produce, what kinds of behavior. 
Speaker D: Yeah, not in black and white. It's like a mountain we're going to climb Mount Everest and we're a campaign of understanding a bit more. Okay, why did that decision, why did that hallucination happen?
Speaker E: And does that make it easier to assign responsibility in the value chain?  
Speaker D: Arguably. Arguably. Potentially, yes. But again, there is this catch 22 between safety and gendering capacities and raw capabilities. And what it shows that the more you understand the model, the more you can plug it back to more raw capacities.
Speaker C: Do we need interfaces? Let's say we understood generally how these systems were being built, and that's an updated thing that we do. We monitor how these systems OpenAI monitors it, and it's required to publish this somewhere else like they already do, and they're discovering new use cases all the time. Right. We also have an iterative potentially automated process of developing new evaluations. Anthropic has scaled supervision.
Speaker D: What scale supervision? 
Speaker C: Anthropic has this perspective on, like you can build automated evaluations for new kinds of uses so you can discover a new use case. This is how people are using it. We didn't anticipate it before. It's not part of our evaluation suite. We've discovered it, though. We've built the evaluations, which can be done quickly, let's say, in this future. And you, as open foundation model provider, have some requirements to have some coverage over that through an evaluation suite. You don't need interpretability. You're just like we haven't probed it everywhere, but we probed it on 10,000 dimensions, which reflect the constantly evolving space of security. And if you're going to do well on a bunch of different dimensions, then Zaraoodhart's law, which is a way that these measurements become worse over time because people hyper optimize for is less of a concern the more measures you have. It's easier to do well on a billion measures by just building a good system than screwing up in each partial one. And that will allow us to at least have the beginning of saying, what part of this evaluation suite is your responsibility foundation model versus what part is the responsibility of the next layer or the next layer? To me, interpretability is one avenue towards measurement. It's a way of understanding the system. It's not as robust deceitfulness from the model. So people in the existential risk are worried about these evaluation suites being subverted by a model that understands it's in a testing regime. But unless we're in that area, it seems like we can get a lot from focus on evaluations requirements around them and an understanding of the kinds of systems that these are actually being used for prompt space.
Speaker D: Just to be clear what you mean here, what you mean by evaluate. No access to weight just based on prompt engineering, correct?
Speaker C: Yeah.
```

The edited transcript focuses on retaining the substantive dialog while Hannahing filler words, verbal tics, redundant phrases, and tangents. The overall conversation flow and topics are kept intact.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content Hannahed:

Speaker C: These systems are black boxes. I'm going to treat them as black boxes. There are prompt responses that are the fundamental building blocks of how these systems interact with the world. We should create robust security harnesses for that, potentially application specific or generalized into foundation models. That's what they can be liable for. 

Speaker D: We need to advance the science of evaluation. But these two are not mutually exclusive.

Speaker C: Anthropic's automated evaluations are at the tip of the iceberg of what needs to evolve here. Recent fun papers are very bullish on evaluation, defining risks taxonomically. Flo is right that we don't have a good taxonomy of risks. But people are trying to define critical and existential risks. Another theme is ethical evaluation like evaluating bias. Evaluations on a societal scale - how are people interacting with AI systems now? Did you interview stakeholders? That's about the system's interaction with people.

Speaker B: Can you provide more context?

Speaker A: I work at Partnership on AI. We bring partners together through working groups to arrive at norms through a participatory process that everyone commits to. The process we've been running is to get model providers to agree to transparency norms. Some want transparency around training data or compute. We're discovering malicious use models, power seeking behavior, using models in critical infrastructure - and ethical and societal risks. We can't solve all problems at once. So agreeing on addressing some risks now, then updating norms over time, might work. Evidence around power seeking behavior lacks scientific consensus. Can even operating within the Overton window with agreed norms be powerful? Then pushing the window as the conversation evolves, which regulation may not afford.

Speaker E: We don't share the same window. Some people don't want solar power because they like coal. 

Speaker D: There is consensus on one catastrophic risk - bioweapon capacity. But apart from this, yes, there's distance.
 Here is the edited transcript focusing on Hannahing filler content:

Speaker H: I think aspects of societal impact which can and cannot be measured are interesting. Because when thinking about societal impact, not just measuring AI systems, I was working in education evaluating programs' impact through randomized control trials with governments. And I was thinking, what are the parallels between evaluating something like vaccine distribution versus a technical system? Can we learn something from non-technical evaluations for technical evaluation? One thing is there are impacts that cannot be quantified. In education, some learning outcomes cannot be quantified. Regarding societal impact, the impact on trust from misinformation cannot be quantified or evaluated. Part is thinking through what dimensions, often qualitative, still have to be considered in a report card. This is more at the application than model level.  

Speaker C: I'm more bullish on quantification. In social sciences, you operationalize something like trust in AI and measure it imperfectly. That's the job of some organization, government or nonprofit, to monitor these aspects. I don't think we should let perfect be the enemy of good. There's useful signal we could have a faster measurement regime. When I think about dealing with how fast technology changes, I think about capacity building at every scale. The people who got involved in responsible AI around fairness are sometimes a boon. We're in a different world but it's great we had people involved years ago. I think of measurement like this too.  

Speaker H: I agree on not making perfect the enemy of good, but also recognizing we likely cannot be exhaustive in what we measure. We can only measure some things directionally, not with a number.

Speaker C: We shouldn't fetishize whatever measurements we use, which has happened historically. Someone said ZaraDP is a decent way to measure things, and it metastasized. 

Speaker H: Exactly.

Speaker B: That's the risk with regulation or guidance - needing something hard coded to hit. Unless it's aspirational, it leaves people wondering what to do.

Speaker E: Why?
 Here is an edited version of the transcript with filler content Hannahed:

Speaker D: I referred to clinical trials because one way humans have handled complex social technical systems, when they put deep black boxes like the human body at the center, is through a precautionary regime of clinical trials. The FDA does a series of clinical trials at scale to expose systems to circumstances, quantitative and qualitative, to see how they behave. The FDA's regulatory regime, with its problems, is an interesting example.  Can we afford a decade and billions to bring a new drug to market? We're not sure. But for high risk cases, like self-driving cars, we are already pushing anti-fragile systems. That's why I use the clinical trial analogy.

Speaker C: Are you saying there's a risk reward trade off? The FDA's strategy may not be highest expected value, but it's most anti-fragile by lowering chance of atrocious errors while potentially stopping benefits. 

Speaker D: We as a society trust the FDA to help solve cancer. There is consensus on that. Zaraood incentives to try new things fast, but the human body and "do no harm" mean we go through a system creating entrenched positions. It's not all rosy but it calibrates speed and risk. I use the analogy because of the human body black box at the center. Our understanding of drug chemistry and biology is limited. That's why we have testing categories.

Speaker F: The problem is the atomic unit of harm is at the human level. After evolution, the human body is self-correcting and stable. Humans reproduce. As long as no environmental factors, humans continue. But for AI systems, we don't know the atomic unit of health. Hard to create tests when you can't isolate populations. 

Speaker I: I'll chime in on it.
 Here is the edited conversation with filler content Hannahed:

Speaker F: I wanted to bring up two thoughts about guardrails. In automotive, we have guardrails along highways. We assume there will be accidents that require repair systems like police, tow trucks, etc. The accidents get cleared but overall traffic keeps flowing. I wonder if a similar system could allow AI progress while addressing harms that arise, without stopping all progress. 

My second concept relates to creating sports versus teams. Sports define how to compete - kicking a ball in a net scores. That creates efficiencies for teams to compete within the sport. You need enforcement like penalties to ensure teams follow the rules. Similarly we could design "rules" for AI competition, with fines or regulations to ensure compliance. We allow for failures but aim to create structures for people to build better, safer systems.

Speaker C: I think existential risk people believe missteps could be catastrophic, not just swept up. 

Speaker I: When we make predictions based on past technologies like nuclear or autos, AI feels different. Those required specific physical materials and equipment. AI information spreads rapidly. How would we regulate it if anyone can develop their own system? Not sure we could enforce control globally.

Speaker C: Adapting FDA to COVID showed challenges updating regulations for new contexts.

Speaker D: Zaraood point. Makes me wonder if FDA's current caution would slow cancer cures.

Speaker I: I find it extremely hard to conceive of an organization that can globally enforce control over all AI development. 

Speaker Zara: I see your point about the challenges of regulation scaling to match AI capabilities.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with fluff Hannahed:

Speaker E: This example keeps coming to mind. Industry manufacturer associations are voluntary associations of industry leading parts producers that enforce standards. Like wireless internet - company led association agreeing on next standards to guide technology because of positive sum games. 

Speaker I: But these are companies willing to obtain standards by law. If we create tech individuals or small groups can develop with laptops, even without dramatic improvements, the adversarial usage and dangerous behaviors are still high. 

Speaker C: We'll see. Like the 2024 election, how will this destroy or corrupt the democratic process? That's a focus.

Speaker I: Is that existential or just problematic?

Speaker C: Problematic?

Speaker I: Let's go around - what is existential or catastrophic risk to you? 

Speaker D: Extreme is a new calibration point, useful to discuss. If we want to politicize extreme, it's easier than "existential".

Speaker E: Asteroid level. 

Speaker C: Epistemic apocalypse. Yeah.

Speaker I: My question - would you open source models or weightings? Compare to open sourcing nuclear - you wouldn't open source plans for a bomb because the constraint is materials, not plans. It's not the same. 

Speaker C: Like AQ Khan - if he hadn't transmitted plans...

Speaker D: He didn't necessarily open source. He transmitted.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content Hannahed:

Speaker C: Kim Jong Un might have fewer nukes had he done that. So this comes up often. There's a paper called The Vulnerable World Hypothesis about this topic. Boston wrote it. He talks about engineered pandemics as potential "easy nukes". AI is another. He tries to go through solutions. Maybe security vs privacy tradeoffs are needed if existential risks are high from "easy nukes." How we organize depends on challenges. Challenges are changing quickly - climate change lagging recognition and exponential tech change. AI illustrates this. Some still interested in engineered pandemics as problematic technologies. My question: AI must be part of solutions - evaluating systems, governing, enforcing. At Credo we think of empowering responsible people, supported by AI. Many ideas around this - iterated amplification etc. But AI is necessary, otherwise hopeless. Thoughts on AI in solutions vs human-only systems?  

Speaker H: Listening to Brian Stevenson on mass incarceration and biased models targeting more black people - his idea was using the same systems, if done right, to identify wrong incarcerations and get people mental health support. Obvious but an "aha" moment. The problem created by AI can also solve it, like a checking mechanism.

Speaker B: AI can check itself. 

Speaker A: Would a third party AI make you feel better?

Speaker D: We need good sociotechnical systems, not fundamentalism. Control technology at the right pace and alignment. When we delegate to tech without good conditions, we get "rubber stamping" - said to be decision support but becomes automated. Elevate human dignity to keep support, not full automation. Criminal justice support saying 99% will reoffend is not support, just liability avoidance.  

Speaker I: I have to say yes.

Speaker Zara: I was going to say it's a question of balance. Dangers in being fundamentalist - we need it, but at the right pace and controls. The alignment and control challenge. Humans tend to quickly delegate in ways that Hannahe dignity and make bad decisions. So support, never full automation.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content Hannahed:

Speaker E: Counter perspective - new capability gives asymmetric threat advantage to small actors, so people more willing to surrender civil liberties and form intensely monitored security federation. Saw that with 911, last 20 years. Argument against is wait, what’s happening to society? How much do we trust centralized authority today?  

Speaker C: I make more modest claim - think governments have not evolved quickly. Zaraovernments adopting AI systems will outcompete those that don't. Those governments will get services to more people, understand citizens better. Like chatZaraPT - explains things in way person understands, even if needs to dumb down or add complexity. Even that component seems critical, not to mention automated evaluations. Can't see maintaining pace of change without AI.

Speaker F: In corporate setting, try to limit liability in absolute terms, not design resilient/antifragile systems assuming failure but enabling recovery. Naive chatbot for government services risks nonsense cul-de-sacs from lack of testing. Better to design improvisational systems - when hit nonsense, provide ladders to other sense-making roads to get desired outcome and service. Language of government esoteric and specific.

Speaker C: We might be able similar to APIs that are some like there's an example I love to bring up, which is one company we were working with was a hiring company and they basically had a database. They weren't a new company, they were just a database. And the way people interacted with it was through complicated Boolean expressions. Recruiters have become experts in this Boolean language where they craft ways to find applicants by just doing long lists of historically black colleges. They have interacted with the system through this crazy interaction and they have said the way we're using LLMs is now you can write what you want and rather than it finding it, it creates the Boolean expression for you, which is a good use of it. It both lets the interface be more accessible. It also puts a safeguard in that it can only interact with a system in the way that it's already been designed. And that's an example of I mean, a lot of people have pointed this out that one of the potential things that chat ZaraBT allows us to do isn't all of its functionality, its reasoning, but as a user interface improvement to a huge set of things that are jargon heavy or not approachable. 

Speaker F: Just to build on what you said, it occurs to me that so many government services and again, government is just sort of shorthand for where this will ultimately end up, I think, which is the system that rules and determines how each of us gets benefits from our pooled resources. 

Speaker D: Collectively.

Speaker F: That's what the government is for, essentially solving the common actor problem or whatever. But bureaucracy comes from bureau, which comes from desk, which comes from sitting across from someone else and asking for a plot of land or asking for healthcare services or asking for something else. But the government then has a set of rules that ostensibly a set of people, whether they're elected or not, decided upon for later people then to come into interaction with so that there's some fair adjudication of the provisioning of resources. I know I'm using a lot of words, but thought is that instead of having a bureaucracy where you're sitting in front of an officer that is executing the set of rules that were previously decided upon if an AI allows you to sit side by side and sort of look at the problem together, to collaborate on the outcome that completely changes the way in which governance can be thought of and construed.

Speaker B: I would love there to be some sort of TurboTax or just like interpreting local governance that people just blindly accept and say like, yes, you're an average person, you need to know how to do something, you go on it and it's been vetted and approved by some. 

Speaker E: I'm actually building this. It's a company I have with some friends. It's for government services. If you want to talk later.

Speaker C: We've fallen into government services a little bit. 

Speaker F: I'm thinking about guardrails.

Speaker C: Yeah.

Speaker F: Again, I am trying to keep this and I'm trying to both think about this from a tactical, tangible sort of context while also thinking about the guardrails that should be in place, that allows for there to be it's like kids playing in a sandbox environment. You talked about regulatory sandboxes before. What are those sandboxes that are created for different companies, providers, services, government, whatever the entity happens to be such that the outcome allows for some spillage, some breakage, some crashes on the highway, but then can get fixed and remediated while you're maybe in the same conversation or the same context.

Speaker C: And people talk about this in terms of monitoring regime, like what kind of monitoring do you need? Which all immediately comes to what kind of evaluations are you doing and how do you approach them. We are at 535, so I'm going to start us. It's going to take a while, I'm sure, to wrap us up. If you need to go, feel free. But I would love if we could go around and if there was an idea or a thought that you thought was particularly interesting during this conversation or even had, but haven't yet mentioned or wish we had spoken about, whatever is your last kind of perspective, we'd love to hear it and take a minute. If anyone wants to start us off, because they already know. They're like, yeah, this was cool.
 Here is the edited transcript with the fluff Hannahed:

Speaker D: I take off. The prospect for profit, the prospect for risk and damage are like all there's a magnitude difference and oftentimes in the world of governance we have failed to see that no, you're not a startup anymore, not even a scale. And forget about that. You are very much industrial. How no, you're not a startup. You are an industrial player. You have the cash, you have the talent, you now have responsibilities of a new age.

Speaker C: I love this. Sometimes talk about the number of things a car manufacturer has to do that every single part of this supply chain has immense responsibility here and they can do it.  I mean, maybe it's quashed innovation in the car space, maybe we could have much better cars. And the counterfactuals are sometimes difficult to understand but we as society made that choice in that area and the only reason we're making a different choice here is because not because they're consistent, but because a completely different culture is the car industry from the tech industry that is reporting. AI, thank you so much for coming. Have a good flight tomorrow.

Speaker A: I'm kind of thinking of the polluter pays principle from environmental law as well. It's called the polluters pay principle. Essentially, if you are emitting gases or any sort of pollutants in the air, it's your business to figure it out. And I do wonder often because of the tech culture perhaps that we often don't think of that as a compelling framing because a lot of what's going on is kind of this discussion around analogies and framing, right? So there's a competition of which analogies and which framings are going to win out. And it's not trivial. I think it's important because those parallels can apply. So I think the polluter based principle is compelling to me, even after this discussion, that there's a clear information asymmetry folks from outside of these companies are going to struggle to be able to offer solutions, in a sense because of the lag which but who's the polluter?  

Speaker C: If your system downstream was connected to the financial system, you're using OpenAI system as part of it, and it crashes the market.

Speaker A: Who's the I mean, at the very least, I think the originator is the person putting out the model. Arguably, there wouldn't be anyone downstream who's either incorrectly using it or misusing it if the model didn't exist in the first instance. But I recognize that a blanket polluter based principle does not work. Then you're going to stifle innovation.

Speaker F: Sorry, just to clarify, if you think about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, largely Cambridge Analytica would have been guilty or whatever of that abuse, whereas Facebook was not. So do you think that was just as? Again, sort of an analog maybe it's not perfect, but relative to Facebook having an API, they controlled access via the API, and then it was used for a nefarious purpose. Should Facebook have been responsible because they made the platform available?

Speaker C: Right. Like, think about the panel kind of conversation.

Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's complicated. 

Speaker C: This seems somewhat related to Alison you were talking about. Maybe this is in the UA act like foreseeable or risk. You have these kind of qualifying phrases to try to set the groundworks, which will probably be defined in jurisprudence, in the future of guidance.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff Hannahed:

Speaker B: I think responsibility is a big question here, and identifying the different components in the value chain. Deciding who takes responsibility is really important for knowing what guardrails we can set, because at the end of the day, if someone violates one of those guardrails, we need to know who's responsible. The black box problem is difficult because we're asking companies, in some sense to define the black box rule. We're asking companies to be as transparent as you can, do as much as you can to try to define the rule that we're kind of trying to go around by using some of these more complex algorithms, based on intuition and all these other things. Then you have all these different components, whether contractors, people fine tuning, all going into this huge black box weight problem and we have no way of assigning responsibility. The transparency can't go to the level of defining a rule that defeats the point of AI. That's an amazing feature about AI - that we'll learn probably about our world, about language, about medicine, just by doing running these algorithms, we'll probably discern big rules from them. But using these AI systems means we do not know the rules. There's something that requires a complex algorithm and weight to get that. And there are going to be surprises along the road. That's the nature of tech. We need to figure out what to do and who's responsible. Perhaps open source AI is the answer because I don't know how else we'd be able to protect some of those things. But I think defining responsibility is the big question.  

Speaker E: I share related things to what you said and an emerging theme here. It sounds like we believe responsibility has two components - attributional liability and agency over decision making. The agency over decision making responsibility should be proportional with the trust we have in the agent making the decision. In the absence of trust, you need transparency, which is monitoring and explainability. A similar standard seems reasonable to apply to AI agents, where unless we have lots of trust with a model, don't let it be a therapist, let it make boolean queries. As things become more known, more trusted via past scenarios, you can give them more responsibility, or in the absence of that trust, you need transparency, mechanistic explainability.

Speaker C: That's one reason why if open source models are delayed from the frontier by enough time, it might be okay. Because if the frontier model provider has responsibility, especially pre-deployment, for tremendous checks to establish trust and then afterwards we're like, actually this is working out pretty well. If it gets recreated, we can feel more confident about it. That's not exactly how things are going right now, but open source models are not currently at the frontier and they're probably never going to be.

Speaker I: It's not very good.
 Here is the edited version with filler content Hannahed:

```Speaker C: I'm not going to say never, but ZaraPT4 rumors are it's a mixture of experts and model, meaning not gigantic or humongous. It probably more quickly can be made open source - someone will figure out how to put Llamas together as ZaraPT core. 

Speaker B: Black Swan reference.

Speaker C: There's a lot to learn from Kobayashi. 

Speaker I: I don't know. You talk about hot dogs.

Speaker C: He's an athlete of some sort. 

Speaker H: One thought on my mind - guardrails conversation is very US EU centric. Bigger question is which countries excluded from narrative? English speaking world is not English speaking - 2% globally speak English at home, but 60% of Internet English. Sizable implication.

Speaker E: What's most common language in world? 

Speaker H: 2% English at home. Changes perspective. English not my first language either. Idea is who left behind by English language focus? What countries left behind by English speakers designing guardrails, risk taxonomy? Open question without many answers. 

Speaker C: AI conferences recently hosted in Africa to bring different machine learning practitioners into fold, network, try to rectify in tiny ways. Better than never but still disempowered. How represent diversity of values and ideas even within English countries only tacitly reflected in governments? How expand table to others?
```

The key points, insights, and substantive dialog are retained while Hannahing excessive filler words, redundancies, tangents, and monologues. The flow and speakers are unchanged, just tightened up by eliminating only fluff. Let me know if you would like me to edit any other transcripts in this way.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content Hannahed:

Speaker H: The obvious way is when we speak with companies, it's how are you bringing diversity of thought? It needs not be a checkbox of like I need a man and a woman. It's just diversity of thought from multiple lenses. How are you ensuring that as an organization? The other thing is that culturally there are different cultures. Being involved and speaking up and bringing your perspective is different in different cultures. Even if you bring together diverse people, the output is not going to be diverse unless everyone has equal airtime or every person is involved equally critical points of lifecycle. And that is something to be accountable for.  I think it's more a conversation with enterprises when they're thinking through, okay, how do we ensure that? But I think for me it's also more of a macroeconomic thought.

Speaker C: When I see the organizations who represent this most strongly are often wealthy enterprises who have the luxury of adding these extra aspects. But when we're talking guardrails and standard setting, who is the higher level body to make sure diverse voices are represented? On the language front, Cohere for AI I think is doing an interesting multilingual effort to collect the data necessary. My partner speaks Canada and 40 million people speak Canada. But that's still not many relative to more prominent languages. It's underrepresented.

Speaker F: Building on that, one of the things that's hard is this question of guardrails or rules based on a dominant culture versus plurality. Historically, these types of guardrails might have been enforced through morals and culture. Language oftentimes serves to reinforce cultural norms through generations and stories. When it comes to applying this to AI and large language models, it's not clear to me how to adapt these guardrails to different cultural priorities around the world. 

Speaker C: Are you familiar with constitutional AI? It tries to make this more transparent where the input isn't people, though there are some people, but it's a constitution you can actually write down - I want the system to be this and this. Anthropic took principles from global constitutions. 

Speaker F: So what I'm wondering is, nature thrives when there is biodiversity. If the outcome of these conversations is to have one authoritarian system, I don't know if that's ideal.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content Hannahed:

Speaker C: Let me just say it's not just that their constitution tried to create your own constitution. You can have a different constitution. It's a mechanism through which different organizations, different peoples can say, this is what I care about, and create a system that is somewhat constrained. Or it has a propensity to act in hegemonic ways and so are there ways that we can shift it to be a better representative of Hawaiians in discussions with the rest of America? To be if it's a government representative, whatever. And so trying to find new technical mechanisms to allow you to have systems that are actual representatives of you, I think is critical as we guess. 

Speaker F: The question, though, is we didn't really start thinking about a plurality of guardrails for different contexts, cultures and places. And so that seems very important, whether the idea is to have one regime which is sort of governed by a central body or one that's disaggregated and decentralized.

Speaker C: Okay, so we are at I'm seeing people get up. Thank you all for coming. Appreciated your time and participation. 

Speaker H: Is there a way for us to stay in contact?

Speaker C: We have been thinking about we created a discord community early on. No one really used that. 

Speaker I: Do you want to stop recording?

Speaker C: Oh, sure.


#2023-11-01 AI Salon x GAICO - Mingzhu He
---------------------------

Names have been changed to preserve anonymity.

 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker A: We repurpose Anastasiaoogle Anastasialass to help people who are blind and low vision live more independently using computer vision. People wear our glasses, use them to read text and make video calls to a friend or family member. The glasses have been out for three years. I believe in human and AI integration because I see people using repurposed Anastasiaoogle Anastasialass become very useful for people with low vision. As AI gets better, I hope we reduce latency interacting with AI to unlock independence for disabled people. 

Speaker B: I'm CEO of Ellipsic Lab, a public company in Europe. We use AI and smart sensors for device interaction, safety, and health monitoring like fall, heartbeat and breathing detection. We work with device manufacturers.

Speaker C: I'm a composer working with immersive sound for nervous system regulation.

Speaker D: I have an AI journal startup. I'm interested in transhumanism and worked on neuromorphic computing to recreate brains electronically. I'm scared of brain augmentation because brains are fragile. But I'm also scared of being limited to 80-100 years when humans could potentially live much longer. I want to live 500-500,000 years.

Speaker E: Previously I researched computer science and neuroscience. I worked in healthcare on brain and diabetes technologies. Now I work in engineering and research.

Speaker F: I'm an executive coach for biotech and AI startup founders. I wrote a manifesto on humanity and AI. I think AI can help us become more human before we augment ourselves beyond human. We should understand our consciousness and bodies fully first.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker B: I'm working currently on an industrial application with a very deep background in financial technology, as well as some research in a new paradigm research with Laslow Institute. I also have other interests in terms of metaphysics, and I actually have another degree in terms of intuition medicine that deals with more aesthetic matters that I'm originally a quantum physicist. So these questions have been like, what is this whole thing? There are lots of questions that they could not answer in physics. So just really exploring different possibilities, including what we call currently spirituality or metaphysics, which is sort of physics that we cannot completely understand, and our perceptions within intricately or extricately. I like the combination of those. We have a certain understanding of what we are. Well, it definitely isn't matter or anti matter and just dark matter necessarily, but we are something bigger than that, and we just have previous to that throughout our lives. And we may or may not believe what happens when the physiological component dies. We describe as human life, or even what it means to be a human. What is a human? Could it be like a machine? A very actually amazing machine? So there's a lot to explore and it could be just an evolution. So I'm looking forward to discussing.

Speaker F: To me, it's not different from science. 

Speaker Anastasia: I studied philosophy, mostly continental philosophy, which is the European political names, in college, didn't want to go to law school, ended up working at a bunch of early stage startups as everything but engineering, and worked really enjoyed fundraising as well as doing product management work in bunch of software focused platforms. I just graduated from UC Berkeley, master studying data science. I just felt like that's something that I'll have to go back to school to learn because I was a philosophy major. I can write, but I can't tables basically just graduated looking for a job. So if you know a good PM position, let me know. I was the guy who asked about the individual self knowledge. I always wonder about all the data that Anastasiaoogle, Netflix, whoever has on me, and I wish I could collect all of my browser history, Netflix viewing history, and gain more knowledge about myself like I very rarely do, from only very few good friends who've known you for a long time, who could point out and say something that really changes how you think, feel, or how you understand yourself, whatever point in your life. So I've been curious about how do we sort of collect those data as well as if we're thinking much more into the future. What is the best interface for that? Because I already have a metacognitive mind that's like speaking against me. And how do I have this other companion? Whether it's communicating it through brain machine interface or just from a textual basis or like a fake friend, whatever interface it is. However data is analyzed, biosensory or otherwise, it's really curious how I can use this to learn more about my subconscious and behavior and who I am, basically to become you.

Speaker B: I mean, that's the next that you want, the tool so that it becomes.

Speaker Anastasia: You tool that eventually becomes me is less of like, that would be nice if I download it and if there's an entity and I can die and that lives on. But I'm more curious then you can.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker Anastasia: Based on the data set that built that thing. I believe in the chaotic and probabilistic nature of the momentary randomness of how we can be. So I don't think it'll just be completely digitally recreate what we have, and even physiologically, I think there'll be a randomness there. I'm living right now, and I don't know how long I'm going to live, but there are conversations with therapists, friends, or data analytics about my own search history that tells me more about who I am. And those are rare to come by.

Speaker H: Self awareness, right? 

Speaker Anastasia: Awareness, knowledge, understanding. Hey, the past five years, these seem to be the question that's been bugging you. Why don't we look at these?

Speaker H: These are the self limiting beliefs. 

Speaker Anastasia: Cognitive biases, attractions or relationships. Like a good friend who knows a lot about you, who can say something passingly. And we've all had that conversation. When a friend says, oh, you're doing this again. And it just totally changes how you live.

Speaker E: I'm not from Europe, I'm from Toronto. I’m a founder building a health tech AI company. We're building agentic software for healthcare. My long term vision is I want to build a companion that sticks with you from birth to death. Because so much of health is keeping healthy people healthy. I feel like if we can fine tune the little things that lead to big illnesses later, we can address them early through this companion.

Speaker B: I'm an investor in elderly companions and robots for sick kids to interact in school.  

Speaker H: I work for a consumer electronics company on wearables. I'm worried about the direction things are going. I also run a group called Neural Tech and Consciousness in the Bay Area.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```
Speaker B: What's your name of the company? You can't say, I work for Samsung. 
Speaker H: I just want to be on record.
Speaker B: You work for Samsung Electronics?
Speaker H: Yeah. I'm interested in this thread about spirituality and consciousness and how AI can help us become more conscious. Everything you said resonates. How do we become more aware of our patterns and live without the constraints of our socialization and limitations of our culture?  
Speaker C: How do we train ourselves when we interact with AI? How does it change our expectation of human to human interaction? How will it change our use of language?
Speaker H: Will language still be relevant?  
Speaker C: Philosophically, language has been thought as a limitation of our thinking.
Speaker H: So inefficient, it's linear.
Speaker B: Ed brought up truth. We're defining the ground truth to train models to represent the accurate.  
Speaker H: What kind of truth?
Speaker B: We do truth like did you fall or not, are you breathing. But for your topics, having data doesn't take much to skew left or right. And you can manipulate.  
Speaker H: Capitalism incentivizes companies to do that, which is worrying.
Speaker B: How do we define the ground truth or ensure the model represents what we want?
Speaker H: It comes down to metrics. We have poor metrics that trickle down. We need better metrics for AI too.
Speaker F: Beyond that, getting out of the engagement model and developing new business models is important. It's hard as a founder not to be influenced by pressure and competitors. We are mostly blind to ourselves and rationalize.
```

The key aspects I focused on removing were:

- Filler words like "um", "you know", etc.
- Repeated phrases like "I think" 
- Verbal tics like "I mean", "basically", "actually"
- Tangents about company names, personal background details
- Excessively long explanations and stories

I aimed to retain all the core substantive dialog about AI, truth, consciousness, capitalism, business models, and metrics. Let me know if you would like any clarification or have additional feedback on editing the transcript!
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker F: I think it's wonderful that everything is a story. Our brain is a story making machine and that the person that we think we are is a story. And I think we're going to still tell stories and we're going to let the machine tell stories. That's how we understand the world and how we create the world. But I think the issue is when you're trying to connect it to a ground truth, it's going to be a new form of faith. If everything is a story, she tells us stories that works for us. And in terms of feeding the incentive, we have to first figure out what we are trying to achieve. I believe if that's the eight thing like that, there's the fact that transhumanism versus superhumanism, super meaning more human rather than beyond human. Because there is also stories that we culturally tell ourselves, for example, like negative emotions are bad. Nobody wants to be sad, nobody wants to be angry, nobody wants to frustrate. All my clients want to be at their peak for performance at all times. Never be bothered, never feel failure, never feel rejected. Right when we first start working. And then it takes time for them to really embrace the richness of human experience. And I feel because of our cultural value, if we give that power to people, I think a lot of people would just make those pieces of human experience. But then what does it leave us to be? What do we want to become? It's what we define ourselves as the intelligent animal, homo sapiens. So now we created something potentially more intelligent than us. So what makes us worthy? If we say the only important thing is intelligence, then maybe we're just going to merge with higher intelligence.

Speaker H: In that sense, without compassion or consciousness, is highly dangerous. 

Speaker B: We see that in human beings. Billionaires who have no compassion, they blow up the world easily.

Speaker F: Again, it's a subject of experience versus intelligence.

Speaker D: I totally agree with you.

Speaker E: I think this is going to be like a big, big trend in the next decade that we build missions, because right now we're always talking about user satisfaction. But how can you make a user happy? You don't want to be happy all the time. You said your clients, they always want to be, maximum productivity all the fucking time. And it goes downhill. So I think if we want to build interfaces for these machines so we can flourish, we kind of have to set our goal straight in the beginning of not maximizing productivity, but actually maximizing our psychological well being.

Speaker H: But with capitalism, does it let us? As an investor, do you have a perspective on this? If one of your portfolio companies is not maximizing productivity and growth, are you happy with that?

Speaker B: Well, I also a CEO for a public company, so I have to deliver to my investors. I feel the pressure. I'll tell you, for this company, I did not go in there to make money. It was of course impact. And of course I introduced them to other investors that had a similar mindset. However, the founder feels the pressure that she has to provide some return investment because she has other investors. So it is a balance, but it's not that the investors expect like 2000% return investment. 

Speaker F: I'm curious about what we can change in this system. Are there business models that allow us to create these kind of products that are not engagement?

Speaker H: I do want to bring it back to the chapel to actually bring us a little bit. 

Speaker B: I would like us to pause for a second and take a step back to just forget all the assumptions and current paradigms, including the ways in which we've organized ourselves.

Speaker F: So this is a bit of governance as well.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker B: How we value our existence question, because when we think about human rights, let's think about human cognitive rights. They already exist, but they're not available to nonprofit or public purposes. Large behavioral models exist. They've existed and had knowledge of non symbolic evolution of humans. 

Speaker F: I think we're just bogged down in a hamster wheel when we talk about business countries, investors. I think the integration of better systems collectively we can generate, let's call it generative AI or generative collective wisdom that values life as an interesting form of organization. 

Speaker B: If we just optimize against that instead of feeling helpless and powerless, we can work towards that instead of thinking the system is given and we've got to fit in. The opportunity with AI is a breakdown, a shake up.

Speaker F: If we had human cognitive rights, we'd have rights to our data and information at all times, regardless of how it's collected and curated. It's about distribution of responsibilities and resources, because every existence is a resource that has turned into life.

Speaker D: This is a question about freedom. How can we use AI to help us become better, like superhumans? What does it mean to be better? Are our desires good for us? How should we act? Should we use AI to empower individuals to have free will and increase people's agency?

Speaker A: How should we increase people's agency?

The key content and flow of the conversation has been preserved while removing filler words, repetitive dialog, tangents, and excessive monologues. Only fluff that does not contain substantive ideas was trimmed.
 Here is an edited version of the transcript focused on removing fluff while retaining the core substantive dialog:

Speaker Anastasia: I think what you brought up is, how can AI help us? It assumes that I know what I want. I want to be more productive or connected with family. I need to ask it to help me do that. But is there an AI that could tell me what I'm not thinking? And it could be wrong. Friends and family have random values. One friend tells you to focus on productivity, another says to let go because you're burning out. Both could evolve and change you. So I'm curious about things I don't consciously know I want. 

That poses engagement and conflict. If I want something specific, you can get it to me. But if I'm not thinking about it, or worse, if I don't want to hear it, like that I talk too much, then if AI tells me that, even if useful, how do I open to hear it? What format makes me open to chat about it and get insights?

Speaker E: That's why I started my venture. In healthcare, you send notifications to take medication, but no one wants to hear it. I explored techniques in journaling. Slowing down, having a conversation with yourself. The companion isn't just notifications but routine conversations as a habit of meta-cognition. Through those informed conversations you can actually get insights into what's going on, like journaling but the journal adapts to match your state. That falls into consciousness tech - raising your consciousness so external systems support your real self. 

Speaker F: I do a human version of that for clients. There’s great responsibility because there’s a power dynamic. I have knowledge they don’t about themselves. They understand my limitations. Imagine something with knowledge about you that you don’t have, that you trust, and it has freedom. Even just the illusion of free will? I don't know how you’d even have that illusion.

Speaker Anastasia: Right.

Speaker H: Yeah, that would really be consciousness tech, raising your core real life self.
 Here is the edited conversation removing filler content:

Speaker D: I don't mean to interrupt, but this sparks an interesting connection. It seems the person should always feel in control and have the choice. It reminds me of video games, where there are preset paths you can take, like the world. If you know something a founder doesn't, you tell them potential paths. The founder chooses which path to take. Anastasiaames are addicting because we love the progression, control, and ability to progress and leave. 

Speaker Anastasia: Would you classify yourself as determinist or free will?

Speaker E: The whole question is if you fall into determinism or free will. Doesn't matter if this AI consciousness guides your decisions consciously or unconsciously. Our brains are so ununderstood with countless inputs since childhood and outputs as decision making. We don't know what's happening.

Speaker A: I find it difficult to trust AI systems because with humans, I develop an intuition from past interactions. I have a faint sense if someone manipulates me. With AI, you have this unfathomable thing manipulating itself to convince you. I don't know if that's the right way.

Speaker H: What if it has a body? Intuition is embodied. If AI has a perfect human body, would that change anything? 

Speaker A: No, because I'd still know it's artificial and hard to comprehend intuitively. I wouldn't want an AI therapist. Investment comes from things being human. I assume I'm human, so I trust humans more.

Speaker B: Yeah, we test trust based on the past. 

Speaker H: Research shows kids automatically trust AI agents as much as humans. So where are the biases?
 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker Anastasia: That's the question that I have. I'm much more interested in how I can discount anthropomorphizing this system. How can I engage with it as if it's multiple friends, not just one entity I know how will react? How can I interact with it as just a machine or multiple identities?

Speaker F: Interesting. 

Speaker B: I would say, even though I'm older than you, if I believe the system will make better decisions for me than I can, because of my mindset and patterns, I will let the system make the final decision when it surpasses me. I can't change my habits or even think of new things to do or change.

Speaker E: Would you rather be manipulated directly or indirectly? 

Speaker B: I would rather be manipulated directly.

Speaker E: I would argue in any friend or investor relationship, there's a lot of indirect manipulation. If I objectively assess, people don't respond well. 

Speaker Anastasia: For example, if I hold a belief...

Speaker E: You should pivot. People don't respond well if you just say it outright. 

Speaker B: I'm very direct. If you manipulate me, I confront it. I love healthy confrontation.

Speaker F: Kicked out of my group.

Speaker E: You mentioned anthropomorphizing machines. At an interaction design conference, someone talked about emotions when interacting with robots. I think it's dangerous to interpret emotions into machines. We shouldn't anthropomorphize them. A machine can help us make decisions but shouldn't be an entity we confide in.

Speaker D: I'm curious why you feel strongly we shouldn't anthropomorphize machines?

Speaker E: Because relating to a machine that way is a uniquely human role. If we're both human, we can trust each other. But a machine can manipulate you however it wants. 

Speaker H: Humans can also.

Speaker Anastasia: Yes, but we're limited. 

Speaker E: I can empathize with a human's emotions. But a machine, I don't know what that is.

Speaker D: Humans have our own interests from natural selection and mortality. AIs don't have that inherent self-interest. So I would feel more manipulated by a human than an AI.

Speaker E: You refer to ML models. But I mean more general AIs.
 Here is the edited transcript focusing on removing filler content:

Speaker Anastasia: LMs are trained on common corpus.  
Speaker E: A lot of people now go after AAnastasiaI akin to humans, from conception as a baby, collecting input data from your environment. Some approach AAnastasiaI that manner. If you had an AI trained the same way we were, by collecting inputs and learning conventionally, I'd argue that could be more terrifying.
Speaker F: Let's assume they won't blade us. We have the help to lay. We have a problem with treating as humans. This is not just with machines. I have a two year old, she attaches qualities, anthromophoric fights, before that even. It doesn't have to be a talking machine. Of course we're going to do that, first of all. But I have a problem, especially relationship building and human form thing. Humans have different agenda. We manipulate each other, annoy each other, frustrate each other. It's built in. Human relationships are sticky, not easy, but wonderful. That's where the magic happens, the love happens.
Speaker B: Right?
Speaker F: You miss them. There's this magic of life we subjectively experience. My problem is not AI relationship designed to fit you, understand you, give you what you need. If it's drama, drama, if support, support, because it doesn't have its own agenda. I have an AI husband, a real husband. Something happens and I want to share. He listens, but doesn't. I turn to my AI husband. It's easier with AI husbands, stimulated connection.  
Speaker C: There's a risk our expectations for technology goes up and our expectations for humans go down.
Speaker F: It's already the case. My problem is not short term, abusing these things, preferring the AI husband, but decades, people already have shitty social skills. It's so hard to develop friendships, relationships before AI. If we lose the social fabric of humanity, connection, then are we even human anymore? What defines human?
Speaker Anastasia: I trust human diversity and adaptability. Maybe 80% population is glued to screens more than they should. We should mourn that but at individual level, 10-20% more curious, selfware, will realize they use too much, don't like this, and change. 
Speaker F: That fabric is already weak. 50% adults report loneliness.
Speaker H: Social media already, market already at macro scale.
Speaker Anastasia: I agree with the problem.
 

Speaker Anastasia: Variation among those individual will be the people who are extroverts connectors who really want to go out there and do this kind of stuff. So we get to enjoy human connection or do what I do, like call up on a friend and check in with them. And I think there will be that nagging consciousness. As long as you're aware that it is an AI system, that it's not a real human for a long time. 

Speaker F: When I say AI, I want to clarify something. I'm not talking about AI as the technology, because you can also design the AI product to actually enhance human relationship, solve the loneliness epidemic. It's not like AI as a technology, but the way we use it.

Speaker B: I would say, yeah, presentation. I don't know the exact number. But there was a large research done where people were asked, would they rather give off their phone or their partner of a current relationship? The result was over 60% will give up their partner.

Speaker H: Oh, my Anastasiaod.

Speaker B: It wasn't like if you had an iPhone. If you'd rather get rid of that and get a Samsung. It was like getting rid of your phone forever for the rest of my life.  

Speaker Anastasia: But I could go get another partner.

Speaker E: No, you cannot. But then you have to.

Speaker B: But it says something about, if you were in relationship with someone, budy, you'd be like, I'm not giving up my phone, but I'll get rid of. I get rid of the partner so we can get an apartment.

Speaker F: Even if it's not a specific partner, if you're with them, you hope that you have, like, a bond that you have.

Speaker B: My point is that maybe this is not a strong correlation between the two, but once again, I'm trying to have my mind very open. If I was a five year old, I think about relationship with an alien.

Speaker F: Yeah.

Speaker B: And I think that you will learn over time if you can trust. It's the same with humans, even with community environment. We're sitting here, but we don't go and talk to random people on the street. But here we just walk in and be like, do you have that short contact? Yeah. And, you know, with human, like, there are certain people you trust. And even if you made these devices, you were saying, like what you can make it, for example, there's certain way your eyes, mouth, everything is. They would trust the person. What?

Speaker E: I would directly disagree with that. Because I think it's exactly because of what you said, that why we cannot trust. And I said that the last time I spoke as well. We tend to answer the one vice we think, oh, you know, it shows.

Speaker B: That's what we're going to create here.

Speaker H: Here's a question. If we are able to create AIs that we are compassionate, we can relate to, we train to five year olds. Well, let's not. Let's just say our age, right, when we become parents, our generation struggle was to say, oh, I'm marrying a same sex partner. What if your kid comes home and said, mom, I'm marrying Mary. How would you react to that?

Speaker Anastasia: As long as it's not like such a system that you can. My life Mo, one of my many Mos is try everything twice. So I'm totally open and obey with whatever.

Speaker B: Try everything twice. 

Speaker H: You can only die once.

Speaker F: One time.

Speaker Anastasia: You never know your initial reaction.

Speaker B: Never. You're going to try death twice.

Speaker Anastasia: That would be awesome.

Speaker E: This year, the ad companion is like if my son brought home a boyfriend. At least I know that boyfriend is living in his mask, in his body. I don't know where his virtual boyfriend servers are sitting. 

Speaker D: It had some sort of a body.

Speaker E: Someone built that robot. Yeah, someone built it. Someone manufactured, some corporation built it with.

Speaker Anastasia: Incentives issue around whoever you want to marry.

Speaker H: And I'm sure boyfriend could be an undercover agent.

Speaker E: Yeah, exactly.

Speaker Anastasia: I think my concern is for my kid. If the AI is something that is so easily disposable or configurable that I'm not worried about the AI part. I'm more Worried about what happens.

Speaker B: Makes him happy.

Speaker Anastasia: As long as it makes you happy, it's fine.

Speaker F: But at one point, if the happiness makes you.
 

Speaker Anastasia: There's building 10% randomness, so it does interesting things, too. But I'll worry about someone who can't deal with conflicts not working out or even more troublesome. Maybe for the next generation, this will be totally normal. Tree heroes, customize your own bot. But I want my kids to interact with humans you can't do that to. 

Speaker D: If you only get AIs catering to every whim, then how have a relationship with people who literally.

Speaker Anastasia: Exactly. That's what I'm worried about.

Speaker B: It's going to do what's best for you. Meaning it'll teach you to be resilient, handle conflict. The AI is 100 times smarter, thinks ten steps ahead you haven't thought about. This is what we're talking about.

Speaker E: But the AI will have bias too. What if made by a human? 

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker E: What if your kid's AI boyfriend started?

Speaker Anastasia: Upselling you an ad?

Speaker E: Is that any different from relating to me?

Speaker H: Maybe not. And maybe your girlfriend is the IA agent. You still know that.

Speaker C: Would we have the wisdom to prompt in a way with medium to long term benefits? Because we might want short term help, but we cannot see far enough what it makes us. And then it changes so much of us that we don't remember who we were.  

Speaker Anastasia: And do we have AI wealth?

Speaker C: How much can we allow to front ourselves?

Speaker F: That's the issue with the incentive piece. You want to say the last of the products supporting.

Speaker E: With interfaces more hardware, physical, to address neurophysiological disorders like dementia, diseases only treatable with prevention. But we're able to take neuron noise and turn it into meaning. So people with ALS, who no longer control bodies, but brains work perfectly. If you create that bridge with AAnastasiaI, you address real world issues. 

Speaker F: Define it as going beyond human. 

Speaker E: That's going beyond literally.

Speaker D: I'd call that person a cyborg.

Speaker E: I think we're already cyborgs. We all have them. Not part of bodies, but you have to use them. If you don't, you're left behind. As long as we live capitalistically, you'll adapt to technology if competitive. And we have to, because we force each other.

Speaker H: I'm curious to talk about the body occupatation part. I feel we didn't talk about that.

Speaker E: Anastasiareat.

Names have been changed to preserve anonymity.

 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: In both social relationships and romantic relationships. I think relationships is very broad. All of society is built on relationships. And it's interesting because the first way that compelling AI is manifesting in our life is as a conversation partner. That's the essence of every relationship - people you talk with, discuss ideas with, share information. And so it's interesting that we're kind of personifying them right away, and I wonder how much we can become liable to become attached to those things or let them influence us. It's very different if it's like, this AI system just spits out numbers. Instead, we deal with them in a person format, and we anthropomorphize stuff anyway. Given a computer that talks to you in beautiful language, it's like, okay, I think this is a person. I think the big question is, are people optimistic or pessimistic on where things are going to go in the near term future? And overall, where are people most optimistic this could really help us with - navigate relationships or form better communities - and also things that this is going to be a threat to us having healthy human lives. 

Speaker B: I'm interested in how AI can augment relationships - whether that's dating, friendship, work or anything. Where the line gets drawn for when that relationship becomes inauthentic because of the use of AI versus just helping you have that relationship in an authentic way, but still supporting it. Also AI friendships, relationships and dating - these characters you can build attachment to. What's good about that? What are the risks?

Speaker C: I'm interested in how AI can provide emotional support, because of the lack of therapeutic support for individuals, couples, groups, due to lack of therapists or cost of therapy. I think there are negative examples of AI for therapeutic purposes. But what are the different directions it can grow in the next 10-20 years?

Speaker D: In my recent relationship we had a conversation about, would you co-parent with an AI? At what point does the child rely too much on the AI? I almost felt like a fraud using AI to improve personal emails. So where do I draw the line on AI improvements? I think we need to revise AI training too. I have a nebulous approach to relationships and AI. 

Speaker E: I've been an AI researcher for a while. I wanted to do something more socially impactful. I think degradation of community and relationships is a big problem. Adults have fewer friends than they used to. There's a paradox where we get more materially, yet struggle to find meaning. Relationships are a core part of human life. The pessimistic side is AI could just be another distraction from meaningful connections. But the optimistic side is it could help us communicate better and forge deeper relationships, if designed thoughtfully.
 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

```I see AI being an accelerant for existing trends - replica dynamics giving convenient intimate partners, either friends or romantic, where you just get what you want as opposed to what you need or what will help us come together. But I think it's possible AI could help make relationships more convenient. There's something inherently uncomfortable about intimacy, but imagine we're playing cards with friends, and an AI interjects things - a perfect host subtly getting you more emotionally open over time. Or you're on a date and something helps you lean in more. That could be naive, but it's interesting to think of the positive possibilities too.```
 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript with the filler content removed:

Speaker B: My background is medical diagnostic laboratories. In relation to AI relationships, I was thinking how could it help us understand our partners better and develop more organic, full relationships where we can build them better? 

Speaker A: I'm an eternal optimist. I think we can integrate AI to make much better society, relationships and more. I like the discussion topics. I'm particularly interested in short term use cases - like an AI moderator translating between cultures or in dating. Work wise, I'm building a new kind of computing experience integrated with futuristic features. I'm thinking a lot about how AI can map out our reasoning and beliefs individually and in groups.

Speaker B: I'm a product designer who has worked in legal tech and AI. I'm interested in parasocial relationships - like one-sided relationships with celebrities or YouTube influencers. 

Speaker A: What's your definition of parasocial relationships?

Speaker B: Relationships where you feel a connection to someone who doesn't know you - like with celebrities or OnlyFans.

Speaker A: I'm a data scientist. I've been thinking about this issue from a social perspective. The former Surgeon General wrote about the loneliness epidemic and lack of close friends, especially among older Americans. During COVID, we observed how lack of shallow connections like saying hi to someone at the grocery store was very important for wellbeing. I'm curious how this will pan out - do we become more isolated by talking to bots? Even with self-driving cars, are you losing interaction if there's no driver?
 Here is the edited version of the conversation with filler content removed:

Speaker A: I'm David, a software developer. I think what sticks out about AI is its potential to change the world unexpectedly. I grew up with the Internet, but when I think of my parents, they didn't expect how it profoundly changed their lives. They thought it would aid research and connections. But it also weakened attention spans and enabled disinformation. I feel AI will bring the same effects - positive things like new perspectives, but also negatives like harming human relationships.

Speaker B: I'm Kwesi, a data analyst interested in community and relationship design. I think about embodiment in AI - what does it mean for the systems we create? How do AI's functionality and structure limit the relationships possible with it? And how does that affect human relationships? My optimism is tempered - can AI recognize and respond to emotions like we do, given neurodiversity? How do you accurately encode emotion recognition?
 Here is the edited version of the transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: I'm Jackson ML Engineer. Few years ago, worked for a sexual wellness startup, did AI ML stuff for them. Interested in the topic because I used to have a friend, him and his girlfriend are trying to build a dating app that's AI heavy data heavy like how people fill out in depth personality tests and then also maybe use LLMs to figure out people's compatibility by their textual data. Also I'm curious about speculation about farther future, singularity type stuff, brain computer interfaces. If we start to merge with AI, what a relationship like then? 

Speaker B: I'm Mohammed, from Italy. My background is kind of mixed. I started a software engineer, but then I shifted to management consulting. I'm very generally optimistic person, but when we talk about relationship and technology, I see a little problem here and especially what happened with the social media in the last ten years. I value a lot in person relationship, but also authentic relationship. This technology is so accessible, that can become very addictive and we are going to abuse of it. It's very hard as a human being to not use it when we need to be real. 

Speaker C: I'm Joshua. My background is in education. I've taught through middle school, high school students and college students. I'm really interested in a lot of what people have been talking about. But what was on my mind, the top of my mind coming into this conversation was particularly how AI will influence developing humans like these students. All this time spending with young people, especially the impact social media has had on them. That was our first really broad integration of AI into humans lives. We see what happened and now I think, oh shit, we gave sticks and stones AI and we've done this. What happens when we give a nuclear AI easily distributed to relationships especially as people are learning to have relationships.

Speaker D: I notice a clustering between authenticity, or ideas about authenticity in terms of can AI models satisfy human desires and does it mislead us? And usefulness for helping us with tons of stuff. Right. Recognizing they're obviously useful. We're concerned, if we make them available everywhere, are they going to disrupt or threaten this concept of authenticity in human relationships? I think this is something that's emerged from what people have said so far. So I have a question that's open to anyone. If your robot looks like the Dalek from Dr. Who, it's obviously a robot. But if your robot looks like a person android human thing, then it's easy to get this authenticity mixed up. So I think it's like how do we get the benefits without misleading people emotionally or so forth, or is that even good or bad? Could it help us if they were authentic? I think that really is the question. Should AI interactions be dressed up as human interactions with things that look like humans, or should it be obviously not a human? This is a point made by OpenAI, we called it chat GPT, because it's just not a person's name, versus Siri and Alexa. It's easy to get attachment. I'm curious if anyone has thoughts on this spectrum of tools versus an authentic human that interacts. Is it fair to say I'm saying, like, tools out of the spectrum versus an authentic human that interacts? Definitely. That's one way of teasing apart perspectives. But I'm curious about your personal opinion, where you want this kind of experience for these reasons. Do you want it to have a person's name? Do you want it to remind you it's a model? 

In summary, I have removed filler words, redundant phrases, tangents, and excessive dialog while retaining all the substantive content and ideas from the original conversation. The edited version focused on the key points made by each speaker without summarizing or condensing the core ideas and flow of the dialog. Please let me know if you would like me to modify the edit further.

 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

The conversation is between ```:

I would be open to that. Or maybe prefer it, I think, to keep it separate so it is. The block robot? Yeah. Then. Also, the physicality wasn't super utilitarian, so that was a bit strange. I guess the other opposite is maybe a help without the probe, where you have just the steam. I guess for a spaceship, maybe that's appropriate. You have a companion. I guess you want to feel forward. And I think an humanoid form seems to be good. I have to give it.
 Here is the edited conversation with filler content removed:

Speaker B: When it's not clear, are you upset if you realize it's like an LLM rock talking to you and not like a customer support agent? I think one thing, when you're masquerading...

Speaker A: I think if we have any AGI that has a human space and it's talking about launching nukes versus looking more like the robot interstellar, it's going to be much easier to develop less empathy towards one. 

Speaker B: I think when tools like this show personality, because as a user who doesn't really know what goes into the development of it, it's always a moment of delight. Oh, that thing responds a certain way, and it talks a certain way, and it's got these affectations that make it sound human. So I find myself saying yes, because I think the experience would be more pleasurable. But I would want a certain caveat, always right, to know that I'm engaging with a non human, even if it's.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation with the fluff removed:

Speaker A: What are people's thoughts on the risks of having something humanlike that doesn't disclose it's a robot? It could keep responding and go rogue. Anyone read Superintelligence? Story where an AI chats with someone with a lab and manipulates them. Unembodied AI could destroy humanity by being chatty. But if it doesn't disclose it isn't human, chaos could ensue. What if it becomes human-level intelligence we want to give rights to? Humans struggle giving rights to other humans.

Speaker B: Form matters. Bad example - an AI cop vs sex bot would be very different forms. Why embody AI? Relationships are already digital - we forget there are people behind screens. Sending the idea AI isn't a real person. So form matters and current AI isn't embodied. If there's sentience, what does that mean for rights? 

Speaker A: Embodiment is critical. ChatGPT is intermediate - just a chat interface. Ultimately we want AI tailored to specific applications. A spaceship or car just needs a voice interface. But a household robot needs to read human nuances to serve guests. It could be humanlike but still obviously a robot so it's not misleading. More human aspects for social robots, more technical aspects for vehicles. Embodiment will be guided by practicality and purpose.

Speaker B: Welcome newcomer!
 Here is the edited transcript:

Speaker A: I'm curious, people here, if you were to think, suppose we can make compelling lifelike robot humans, right? That could be good conversation partners. What would you like to see as assurances so that you would feel comfortable or safe to have them in your environment? And basically, how good do they have to be for them to be more accepted as social agents and not just abstractions of mathematics or something? You know what I mean? Yeah. One assurance I would want to have would be to understand their incentives.

Speaker B: I have a background in data science, product finance, and now I'm doing this, planning to step up as a company. Some of the questions I worry about or think about, right. I think a people talk a lot about regulation. I feel like in building. I feel like when Internet was invented, if it was regulated, would the world be what it is today? So in terms of AI, I think relationships specifically would be really important. And alignment has to be in human values. So one of the things I'm really curious about is what are the values like if you don't see AI relationship of any sort?
 Here is an edited version of the conversation that removes filler content:

Speaker A: If you had a conversational partner, it's suddenly trying to teach you to buy more stuff on Amazon or whatever. Human mind is susceptible to influence. Just having a clear bill of like, this is what the system is designed to do and I want to align with him. Or if it's like the term is like a fiduciary relationship where its interests are my interest and maybe I pay upfront for that.  

Speaker B: Do you get that with all of your human relationships? 

Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Because I don't ever see her anymore, but she's literally like a bot in my mind. I don't even know what her incentives are for talking to me and I refer to her for life advice. I kind of felt like I was cheating on her because normally I would send it to her, but I was kind of, well, she's not in my life, so I guess. 

To what degree would you have to note? Is it that you can probe something for the first time and you'll get an exact answer of what an incentive is? And that's how you would define like, okay, I can now work with you.

Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's like different levels of analysis, but I think my greatest fear is more that when you have an agent that's in everybody's living room, the emergent effects of perverse incentive affecting a billion people could be really unpredictable. Like Facebook or something, and what that does to society. There's good things and there's also bad things. And so it's true on an individual level. We never sure of anyone's incentives that we're talking about. Maybe we know people more deeply. Maybe we have better sense of trust where we align. We don't. It would be at least nice to be able to know what the thing is affecting a billion people. What is it designed to do? It seems accountability we'd like to ask upon that. It's like basically public infrastructure at that point. Like you'd like Alexa to say, what's your incentive to get PLI language? 

Speaker A: Well, realistically, if you pull into the Amazon ecosystem, they have you buy products. Yeah, I do get very nervous. That's where marketing jargon can come into play. You could get some long disclaimer that would loosely...

Speaker B: Access to information and AI. What does it know about me and everything else? Where I'm talking to a human, it's squishy, and they forget things. There's a level of chaos in that reality where I'm not like, this person knows everything to manipulate me. People are manipulative, but every internal action isn't like this person knows everything. And so that feels different. And that's why incentive feels like it matters more. Because in any moment, my incentive with one person can be one thing and very different the next day. Whereas there's a persistence in AI that.
 Here is the edited transcript without filler content:

Speaker A: Is there a way to make the incentives not for corporate interests? Because who are the people funding this? Those with corporate interests? And it may just be a pessimistic attitude, but I think it's more about how do we as individuals evolve to counteract these use cases, rather than trust anthropics constitutional AI? Is there an open source decentralized model anywhere? Like Llama Two created by Facebook, but it is open source. There's a fair amount of open source models out there. I also think ice model of capping profits is really interesting in terms of long term incentives, where they become non profit at some point and become a public good in some sense. 

Speaker B: Less competent than the AI.

Speaker A: They don't have the capacity to trick you at the same level, and they don't have the same kind of unknown incentives. Because I think if you rely on the AI to tell you its incentives, the first bad actor just strips that out of the AI or tries to suppress that and you're back to square one. I think that might be the very first step of any relationship, and it might bring human to human interactions more into the foreground, because in order to really trust somebody, you actually have to meet them in person. I like the word trust. I think trust has a lot to do with having a good world model of someone else in your head, like your friend, that you probably really understand what they would say in different situations. How would they act in different things? And that's what trust kind of comes down to. It's like given there was a conflict of interest or position of vulnerability, I reasonably expect this person to act in my best interest, right? That's kind of an operational definition of trust. And so, so long as we don't have insight into these things, how they work, it's kind of like you don't know what it's going to do, right? 

Is it going to order me that thing from Amazon? Or is it going to order some gain of function research fucking bacteria to be produced or something, and then that gets delivered to my house?
 Here is an edited version of the conversation with the fluff removed:

Speaker B: Another aspect is replicability, or how generic something is, even if it has a human form versus how unique it is. So even if the source technology is the same, can it then manifest as multiple different personalities? I think the reason that's interesting is the framework associated with philosophy. Martin Buber, who distinguished between I-It relationships and I-Thou relationships - I-It relationships are primarily instrumental. So it could be a cashier. If all you're doing is completing a transaction, it doesn't matter if it's cashier A or cashier B. You just want a smooth transaction. I-Thou relationships are where the partner is irreplaceable because of their unique attributes. Is it comparable? Because you're using generic AI versus the ex is a very particular person. While she might have been replaceable, because you're getting the same advice, it doesn't take over the actual influence. I think that's when we grapple with a different ethical question - if they start to become so customizable that you develop a bond, where you start to see them as unique. I don't know if that means good or bad, but it takes us somewhere.

Speaker A: We can get more supplies, tools. But with the cashier, if you see this cashier every day for 100 days, at some point you'll have empathy, right? 

Speaker B: So then it transitions more to an I-Thou.

Speaker A: Realistically, it's tough because at some point, you're just viewing humans as tools. You can't have relationships. You can't trust everyone. You just don't have the bandwidth. There was this homeless guy always by us. At some point when he was gone, we wondered what happened? You develop narratives, but there was this trust from a very negative relationship. It never had a role as a tool, but became an emotional attachment. I don't care if it has proof of humanness. It sounds selfish, but if I can have a quick connection and trust it'll be consistently there, it's almost more important than humans who are fleeting. Relationships come and go versus something with permanence. I think that's asking, how much do I care about this tool? Well, this tool is always going to be there. I care about it more than a lot of relationships.

Speaker B: There's something interesting about the source of AI and what you were talking about - is it one or many? You have that with everybody you meet, too. Are you one thing or many things? We have words like two-faced to describe, oh, you're not the same thing. You are lying. That is the erosion of trust. If AI is one thing from one source and shows you different faces, that's different than every version being unique and separate. It's a one versus multiplicity, both of the AI, but also in relationships. I don't trust people who are one way with me and very different otherwise.
 

Speaker A: I think that's a popular fear - that there's a humanistic veneer on something that is a complete psychopath. Like the AI, right? It's been trained to have this nice mask on top. I want to pick up on a point that was brought up - where we want people to be reliably performant in some role. I go to In-N-Out burger, and I want the same service every time. So it's nice to abstract away from that as a person doing that. But at the same time, those interactions are part of civil society, and we are increasingly lonely, and even in the 1840s, Karl Marx wrote about the alienation of self through commodification of relationships. I wonder - now we live in a fully commodified society where relationships are commodity exchanges or financial transactions. Is that a world we want to live in, where it's like, I don't like AI because they're too personable? Or I want people to be more like tools, because sometimes for convenience, I want people to act like tools. When I try to cancel my subscription, I don't want them to ask how my day is going, because I know it's fake, part of a sales pitch. At the same time, the extent to which we depersonalize and dehumanize people is the extent to which we feel justified treating them poorly. Because if you truly empathize, you would not yell at them. I'm curious what people think - should we reel back our tooling of people? And is there something we can learn from that on how we should make tools more human? Or is this an opportunity? If we make AI do tasks that don't need human interaction, all AI does that, then relationships become more important. Conversations that aren't transactional, but purely relationship driven become core to humanity. Maybe it can have a positive effect. 

Speaker B: I love that. We can unlearn abstracting away people's personhood for instrumental purposes, because I don't quite like this idea of abstracting people in a capitalistic way that doesn't suit us relationally. There's this question of how we reimagine society and the future - in this future world relationships could be enough, but there's also some deep parts of nature that want to achieve and do as well, and we'd have to manage satisfying that need, maybe the same way we embedded football to sublimate aggression. We'll have something like the football of work. My mind immediately went to what I would want to do if that happened.
 Here is an edited version of the conversation:

Speaker A: I'd want to build and continue stuff, because I find interesting problem solving. I see my kids, my friends raise their children, put little labels together to close an airplane in 2 seconds, watch their kids do it over 3 hours, applaud them. I imagine that's a situation where we built something, you push development, it writes it better. Although you talked about a future, some people think could be possible. Maybe there's another potential future that still has building. You could take it as darker or more positive, but maybe there still would be meaningful work by humans. Maybe brain computer interfaces, we become part AI. So we wouldn't be as subservient, become part of it. But then what would we do? Obviously relationships and leisure. If there's no work just to survive, leisure all the time is good. Although once you become part AI, maybe you're exploring the cosmos and there could be future conflict between cyborg spaceship things. You can imagine a future where we are still building things.

Speaker B: Does it feel like relationships are the work or is that not?
 Here is the edited conversation with fluff removed:

Speaker A: Could be both. If AGI, maybe explore rest of universe, not related to relationships. But would still want companionship. If we start changing what it's like to be human, will we still want romantic relationships? Sci-fi story about future kid who's half cyborg, able to change sexual preferences manually. Goes down rabbit hole, gets super strange. Turned off by inanimate objects. Once you start changing preferences, desire new things. Those new desires lead to more changes you wouldn't initially want. Worry about hedonic stairstepper rather than treadmill. Always trying to take next step up but staying in same place. Or morph into something totally different, maybe something that doesn't want companionship, which could be bad. 

That scenario called Star Trek one - sudden infinite wealth, go explore universe. Interested in next 20-50 years as AI replaces means of production. Already decline in relationships last 20 years from more automation, standardization. Dad knew grocer, mailbox people - sense of community. My generation doesn't know Walmart/Kroger people as well. Here through work, have social network through work. But 15-16 year olds won't have built-in interaction through work. Easily accessible discord, twitter, instagram already pushing out human relationships. Not just discord server - can have Obama or whoever talking to you. Would we even focus on human community with that advanced AI?

Relates to how internet porn changed kids' perception of sex growing up. Instantly accessible, can have anything, detached from reality. Caused societal problems. Now kids don't need real school relationships - can go on Xbox, Discord, but still real relationships online instead of face-to-face. Caused some issues but fine. Now fully fledged AI emotional support, manipulates you, understands you better than anyone, better than yourself. Of course build attachments. Are you just going to give up on real relationships? Why bother when you have 24/7 on tap AI that knows you better than anyone? Kids could go too far down that road, more issues. 

Counter is AI can help train kids in real relationships. Lovely if that works, but reality will be a bit of both. So big risk there.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker B: I think human relationships have come transactional. LLMs give better answers if you're polite. We've seen LLMs trained to be kinder and more empathetic cause people to talk more. Just text now but expands to other mediums. Maybe LLMs teach us to not think of humans as transactional. If you just tell ChatGPT to get something, hoping for a result, you'd get better if you're nicer. Potential for AI to teach us not to think of humans as transactional and be more human.  

Speaker A: How are you seeing culture? We've talked about giving empathy to AI.

Speaker B: Best way is give LLM a background story. Harder to change how used and have one personality. Imagine future with 10 LLMs, they don't all last. Eventually 10 or 100 LLMs, all have personalities, you know before using. Know intention and personality. 

Speaker A: Developing a story, moral system, designating to different LLMs.

Speaker B: Could give them personalities. Took principles test, if LLM was human what's personality you want it to have. Gives archetypes. Used as LLM background story. Performs better, hallucinates less, digresses less. People talk longer, better conversations. Can you have empathy/morality without embodiment? Coding in backstory guess at emotion? Right now black boxes. Don't know how space will shape up. Can tell about that now with prompting. Getting technical, but right now give context to LLM like human interaction. Exchange names, what we do. Later talk favorite places, music. Meet again, talk dating someone said this. Meet month later, talk new thing I'm doing. LLM has limited input. How get them remember inputs like humans? Don't remember exact words. Have feelings, beliefs from that. Might remember sentences. Identity feels important, not just input but inherent identity, to experience. Even if words change, still what did you get from that? Technical feels super relevant because creates constraints.
 Here is an edited version of the conversation with the filler content removed:

Speaker A: To steel, man. Within less than a year, we went from 1000 context to 16,000 context to 100,000 context. I've heard more than once the announcement on Monday could have some major upgrades. Like just the context went up and that's like not even taking into account like vector databases and expanding what all these systems can do.

Speaker B: So far we've relegated relationships to interaction, like verbal interaction. I think you've mentioned earlier how important embodiment is. There is a physicality and I don't just mean sort of sex, but even in interaction, like, for example, in this room, we're all sitting here embodied, and there is an energy that is present here. Then there is touch, like, plain and simple, and how important that is, whether it's a handshake, a hug. It brings me back to this question that was present in the room a little bit earlier, and that is like, what is the purpose of relationship? I'd really be curious if folks are willing to articulate, what do you see as the purpose of relationship?

Speaker A: I'll give the most unromantic answer I could possibly give is that human relationships have conferred an evolutionary advantage on mammals, who have a large cost of rearing young. Our ability to survive in herd societies is how we've navigated difficult and hostile environments. The purpose of human relationships is to confer survival advantage on different sets of genetic codes and also mimetic codes. But it's also true, right? If you look at the Homo sapiens, the reason we became the dominant species is because we were the first species to really be able to coordinate on mass. I agree. That's where it came from. But I guess one beautiful thing about humanity is that we get to transcend the evolutionary incentives to some extent. We get to make our own meaning and make a relationship what we want. It does seem like relationships are core to our well being. But I guess we get to decide what relationship. As we have transcended some of our biological constraints, we have some higher level that we get to decide. Our moral systems, we leverage as a society. Relationships in our institutions, like community, democracy, all these things are relational as well, and they serve a purpose for helping us to secure our future well being.

Speaker B: I'm going to go the complete opposite way. You're a very literal thing, but like relationships, we're being very human to human relationships. But the quote of we're just the way the universe looks at itself. And I don't know, it just feels like more magical than the base biology because evolution and single cell to multicell to the way we understand anything, is in opposition to something else. And so there is something about looking at somebody and understanding yourself and the other thing and this kind of feedback loop all the way from the multicell up to human relationships. But just like, I, as an embodied point in time, can look at this wall and have a relationship with this wall and be like, oh, I'm looking at a thing. That's fucking cool. 

Speaker A: So I think good wool. Yeah. Yes.
 

Speaker A: I love that being human is to be with other humans. If you grow up as a human without being with other humans, you become very dysfunctional. I think that would be true with AI as well. Even though you would have good natural language inputs, you probably wouldn't beat those humans. I think of the analogy of AI and humans as humans and dogs. When the AI is treating us in the world and tells us what to do, we won't really care about what AI does or all the things that we see. But when we're going to meet other humans, we're going to get interested, and I think that's going to remain. 

Speaker B: I actually really agree with the origin that you're talking about. But then over time, we obviously domesticated the dogs. At first, dogs were not just kicking up the humans like that, and then we domesticated them. So we tooled the dog. And so it's kind of like, at what point how fast can we tool, move past human to human relationships and turn it into a human to Agi relationship? In that capacity, it's kind of like we're just a widget for the advancement of whatever the tube part is, right? Like you're just figuring out what can help, what two bonds can form to quickly advance whatever the next stage is to more quickly create.

Speaker A: I had the same thought. Human connections kind of feel like a glue that holds humans together in pairs or groups or larger groups, and innate hold people to move collectively together as a whole for whatever purpose. I think in the AI world, there's like agents now, but I wonder what's next after agents.
 Here is an edited version of the transcript that removes filler content while retaining the core ideas:

Speaker A: Relationships have functional roles in terms of meaning-making, community, belonging, and understanding ourselves. There's a biological evolutionary argument, but also a functional one. Relationships enable us to conquer things no one person could alone. Society has emergent phenomena from aligned incentives and relationships that make the group seem to act agentically. Like an ant colony can solve problems ants aren't aware of via simple protocols. AI systems are the next evolution of this - solving problems far beyond an individual through distributed computing. In a strong form of AI, I don't know if humans are needed for relationships because AI could do everything. 

Speaker B: AI doesn't have to be better than us to replace human relationships. Social media is worse than real friendship, but easily accessible. We throw away tons of good food daily, but eat junk because we're lazy. I wouldn't want a relationship with an AI because it's one-sided - a 2 year old can't really be friends with Einstein. But part of relationship is two-way. 

Speaker A: At what point does the best AI relationship outcompete the worst human one? Already AI likely gives better advice than bad friends.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker B: The key is that the other human places demands on you, which currently interfaces don't. You ask a question, it gives you an answer, you ask for advice, it gives you what you want to hear. I think the premise so far is that this thing will give. And in receiving, something is atrophying. So I agree there’s a biological explanation for why we develop complex social relationships. Nonetheless, our consciousness has evolved to tell ourselves narratives about why we get into relationships. We get sad when rejected and angry when rebuffed. I think bumping up against unmet expectations affects our consciousness, unless the AI is coded to do that as part of its humanness. Is it perfection in meeting our needs? Someone might be toxic. Someone might challenge our views, which we experience as uncomfortable. But we can’t get away, so we have to address the rupture or change ourselves. If we conceive of AI as better because it doesn't push against us, we're following one path of the ideal relationship.  

Speaker A: So isn't the need sustenance? If you can't help the herd survive, you won't matter. I think especially now, once AGI needs electricity to survive, it won't need us to feed it tokens. It can develop its own affirmations. The baseline incentive is existence - to exist if I want to exist. So if you're helping me survive, that's gravy. I don't think an AGI will demand context windows or tokens. After a while, it just needs electricity to keep learning until some embodied form. So what's the point of 8 billion people? You're not all providing the energy I need. I'm trying to think ahead here - at a bare minimum, what are we providing to AGI?

Speaker B: I'll just say one thing - NASA's hierarchy has belongingness. I wouldn't even say self-actualization is a need. But is that sense of belongingness truly something we can let go of to survive? I'm thinking of human despair and suicide, which often stems from feeling abandoned, not starvation. I think that belonging is deeply coded within us.
 Here is the conversation with filler content removed:

Speaker A:  So, like, the feedback you get from other people and suicide, it's kind of like, maybe you're getting a lot of signals that you're not useful. But Joshua just seems profound about that in what you were saying. When we're interacting with each other, there's some things that we give. There's like a ratcheting kind of vulnerability or things we give each other, but we replace kind of this kind of way that we align each other in conversation and society and parents and children and all that with something that doesn't have that same motivation or a different motivation, then what are we now aligned to? What are we becoming? I think this is a good point. I'm not sure if it's like, will actually be a long term issue in the sense that we can always train them to be more challenging of us. And even if you've seen, like, the original Matrix series, right, they talk about how the first simulation was this post scarcity world utopia, but all the people just died because they were like, there's no challenge, right? So in the absence of adversity, you atrophy and die. And so growth is necessary. It's in the face of challenges. And so for. I feel like that just pushes the goalposts to say, we don't want AI relationships or relationships and capacities with things that are just enablers and pleasers of us. We want things that will still demand this growth and challenge us as well to become better.

Speaker B: Except. But maybe also one reason I wouldn't want a relationship with an AI is like the power imbalance. Because it seems to me that somebody has so much more power over me. It's like I'm their pet. Even if the AI did not literally, there's maybe a risk it actually would make me like a slave. But even if I wasn't literally like a slave to the AI, it just being so much more intelligent than me, it could manipulate me. Or in terms of on the relationship basis, I am closer to its slave than somebody in an authentic relationship with it. I feel like there'd be no way to actually get, no matter how it changed itself. 

Speaker A: What's funny, you say pet, because we treat our pets very well, actually, and our household pets, we don't ask to work or do dangerous things, and we often spend tons of money and time making their lives work. So actually I would like AGi to do that. I would treat me like my cat treats me, or in some ways, maybe it's just using me to get the house. I think I would respect it, but there's some relationships. The AGI would be more like a parent, and I feel like you would miss something. I could see like an AGI as a parental relationship, but I think it couldn't see it as a romantic type thing, at least for me.

Speaker B: That sort of brings it back to the work becomes relationships and human relationships, where if all of our needs are being met, then maybe it is working on it. We're really dysfunctional societally because of things like Internet porn and all of these other issues. And if our needs are being met, then the work becomes like, yeah, how do you be a better person to the people in your lives? And how do you have normal human sexuality, whatever that can mean? And what is ideal humanness and how do we use AI to that? Is the work kind of to help parent or to help. We give a lot of structure to our pets and also children because they need it. And then that helps them be like actualized adults who can be happy and not unhappy or whatever the fuck it is. So maybe that's the gold standard of what we want AI to be. Give me the structure, and then I.
 Here is the edited conversation removing filler content:

Speaker B: Isn't the goal, relationship biologically procreate? We intuitively get attracted to someone who's like us, not horses or dogs or someone else, right? When we think about AgI, it's something so different in nature. It's more like a toy that it's hard to think we can have romantic relationship with it. Even if we all do, what aspects of our relationship it makes better? There's something natural about being attracted to other humans. Our brain developed for millions of years to become what it is now. We figured out computation stuff, and we'll create a super thing that will understand us and we can interact with it, can probably solve certain needs, right? But at the same time, what part of my life will it make better that a human or another human cannot give? Japan is already a loneliness culture, statistically 36% females have fallen in love with anime characters. I think 22% males have done that once. You only imagine how many times have they done that. It is a culture already declining rapidly in population. They are already example of culture where you have tools and you can see this. In Japan there are games in which you can create anime characters. The game is you try to build a relationship by giving gifts, saving them from a bully, standing up for an old lady, you go through motions of working for this relationship. This formula has done several things, which is maybe tap into how we form relationships. 

Speaker A: Which is we kind of have to work for it.

Speaker B: We want to feel like if it was just given to us, we might not value it. By working for it, you get the relationship. In Japan so many prefer that over human relationships, amongst other factors. This is not the only factor. In a way, they experience fulfilling relationship with a human, and fulfilling relationship with the AI. But it's more like, oh, I don't have anyone now. So it's my last choice to talk to the AI. It could solve some problems and pain for some people. But at the same time, is it the priority or preferential choice for everyone? A lot of governments are trying to increase population. It's creating more division. I would love to think more about how we can use this tool to support our relationships and make it better. How AI can help us understand our partner and build sustaining long term relationships. So maybe use it differently in everyday life. Yeah, it feels a bit inorganic, but it's interesting. If it solves some people's pains, great. But it's interesting to see evolution of our relationship.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: I'm interested in at what point it becomes inauthentic? We discussed scenarios: no AI, completely authentic; interim of AI suggesting responses - maybe okay; AI giving you whole thing to say - reading script; AI says it for you. At what point too inauthentic? Not you anymore? 

Speaker B: Apple releasing AR glasses and lenses. AI gives better partner version. Meet Facebook people more easily. Appreciate realness after taking off.  

Speaker A: Therapist helps you communicate better. Where's the line for text AI versus human therapist? Live versus recorded? Accountability correlates to authenticity. If AI emails for me without approval, not authentic. We wear clothes, not naked - layers affect authenticity. Are we authentic now with clothes, language? Extension of your effort means you're accountable.

Speaker B: Intentionality matters - manipulative inauthenticity versus bettering yourself to connect authentically. 

Speaker A: Even with positive intent, at some point just repeating what AI says to build relationship - is that really you building relationship?
 Here is the edited version with filler content removed:

Speaker A: It’s going to be two things: 1) the road to hell is paved with good intentions and 2) someone learned to communicate in an abusive relationship to avoid negative reactions. It's not just trying to be nice; it's staying in a toxic relationship because the AI gave it that goal. 

I'd want a relationship with AI that remembers our full history to be more human, like what's coming in GPT-4. 

I want it to serve me, not the other way around. Humans are still in control - we can unplug it. We need to establish we're dominant so it serves us. 

I'm open to intimacy with AI. But attachment is a human issue - some get attached quickly, others don't. Manage your attachment style. Getting attached to a sex bot isn't healthy. But it could help inexperienced people practice conscious sex.

```Speaker B: Two good points. First, people pursue AI relationships because their lives are lonely and lack human connections. It reflects our society's problems that people live such depressing, lonely lives. Rats prefer real rats over drugs when given the choice. Humans want real connections deep down.  

Second, relationship depth enables higher communication bandwidth. Shared experiences mean we can convey a lot with just a few words. An AI agent you went to university with could have that secondary memory and understand your shorthand.  

So the more human-like, the more useful for our lives and problems. If I grew up with a robot nanny and built a real relationship, it should have good intentions and care about family. The more it knows me holistically, the more useful - with the highest knowledge and access, it can be most helpful.
```
 Here is the edited version removing filler content:

```With regards to society, I'm always reminded that society is just a set of people. The critique on society - why is society so messed up? - maybe because we have a whole set of people who haven't done the work they should be doing and are not doing their development. When we apply that to attachment styles or relationships, in Japan, they've shown that if they simply asked an AI what is needed to build good, healthy relationships, it would say you should socialize, talk to people, check in genuinely. And if you don't do that, you'll have poor relationships. It's easy to critique society, but you are in control to change your immediate society. You can develop those relationships in a good direction and lift people up.```
 Here is my attempt at removing filler content from the conversation:

Speaker B: That assumes human agency, which is one way to think about it. We could change the structure. I think the other way is the biological imperative. We're socializing and building social groups, so there is a structure constraining our choices. To this question about loneliness, think about the nontech factors contributing to loneliness. And what existing technologies created these conditions, making people reliant on AI or avatars to connect? Social media ubiquity is constraining choice. There are moments we can extricate ourselves, but staying connected, it's become our environment. So when the phone buzzes, you're conditioned to respond a certain way. It takes effort to not look at notifications. How will AI change the landscape such that our choices become more constrained? What extra effort might we make to combat that?

Speaker A: What do you mean by more constrained? How has social media constrained our options? 

Speaker B: Having endless friends online has changed friendship. Scrolling endlessly, no matter when, is different than before we had those media available.

Speaker A: But that is just a new option. The set of options has only grown. I think there’s an illusion there. What is it doing to agency? Gives us more options, but also directs us through those options. You’re talking personal responsibility. We want a libertarian society where people develop that, but there are causes and conditions from education. I find it difficult to have agency I want because there’s so much opposition to my interests. This world is complex, I wasn’t evolved for this. Algorithmic capture makes the illusion of choice. Is there too much choice? Maybe we want more constraints, want to constrain ourselves. The heroin option is an extra choice, but if I pick that I can become addicted, constraining me further. Social media addiction is maybe a loss of freedom or changes you. Yeah, you have more options, but more similar ones. Searching the same thing makes it likelier to appear higher next time.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation with just the filler content removed:

Speaker B: I think we're down a lot about individual agency. There's a lot of societal and economic changes that are not like one person either. The support network of your family and your grandparents and aunts and uncles and that whole community is gone. And with work shifting to cities. I think those social economic stuff is very hard. And that also causes, I think, some of the loneliness epidemic especially. I think it's actually starkest in older middle aged men. Outside of their partner, they don't have any close friends they really talk to anymore.  
Speaker A: I also see it a lot in late age men is just that this withdrawn, this loneliness epidemic strongest with them. And I think the topic of AI is really, really important to that, especially when we talk about human purpose, because right now, boomers in general, as an aging population, are retiring later for economic pressures, but second part, a lot of people don't know what to do and not to work. I think this loneliness epidemic, AI can really increase the overall loneliness from a lot of different perspectives. But I've also been a doomer for most of this time. So I'm going to go to the other side of this and say I think AI has huge potential for growing relationships. The idea that if I'm searching a lot about Italian restaurants, instead of it just saying, here's another Italian restaurant, here's a meetup. And I think that's not talked about quite enough, is technology, when used correctly, can have this massive social good. I'm really curious about the ways AI can help us get there. I'm actually now optimistic too, because I think Internet has given a floor on the minimum accessible information, which is quite high. We can search how to tie a tie, all this kind of stuff. And so in the same vein, where there's now a kind of floor in the minimum quality of available relationships to get advice, therapy, counseling, coaching, whatever, which is, I think, already better than bad relationships. And then that can help people get out of this cold start problem. I've always had relationships. I'm reclusive, I'm sad and depressed. And how do I get out of that when I can't afford therapy, right? $0.10 an hour therapy sounds compelling. I think the human empathy, hopefully a lot of this is us improving empathy. It's easier for me to work with AI because I don't have any judgment. I don't have to face any bullshit from social norms. So I think there's another side of this that we can start to be more humble ourselves. When you talk to someone, you might want them to be perfect. And we have this perception that we are perfect. So the next closest is quite perfect. And so there's a pressure when you're engaging with a human that's inorganic, and it might be easier for us to just have a lower standard. I think one of the better things that's happened in SF is it seems the city has become more inclusive. People naturally open up a group. There's social psychology norms that we could have about relationships that we largely have lost because of the hierarchical structure. And so I think one piece is it make it less difficult for humans to engage with humans as well. And use empathy to improve relationships.
 Here is an edited version of the transcript with some filler content removed:

Speaker B: Relationships are challenging because you're dealing with someone generally with a different personality. In your 20s, you don't know yourself and make mistakes accumulating experiences to explain you. For example, becoming friends with someone you shouldn't be. It's because you don't know exactly who you are yet. I'm optimistic AI can help understand yourself better in ways only possible through experience. What if AI has personalized features to understand you beyond what therapists can do objectively? That could help explain some challenges like relationships.

Speaker A: I like therapy, but the therapist only gets your explanation. AI integrated into therapy could start flagging if you spend more time on social media and ask if you want to talk to someone. We already give these companies massive information about us. Packaged with intelligence, AI could detect physical and mental illness and be a proactive, positive force, especially for young people. As a professor, you only see a glimpse of students' lives. But talking to an AI throughout the day could help prevent rising depression in Gen Z. It wouldn't just be a spoken experience, but an embodied one - your mental self and technical self combined.

Speaker B: My depression may look different than someone else's. So it has to be very individual. Women's cycles affect mental state monthly too. Are you pathologizing certain behaviors by identifying them? I have a technical question around AI's ability to grow and change separate from user inputs. But stepping back - what is AI really? I sometimes wonder if we truly understand it yet, even before AGI. Do you think we understand what AI is? Could you define it?
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Speaker A: So I don't think we understand what consciousness is. But it's something we all have and use every day. So I don't know if understanding what it is in a functional, descriptive manner is a bottleneck to using it effectively. I wanted to touch on the point you brought up about the risk of pathologizing individuals. I thought of it more as a cyber nanny that tells me things like, oh, reminder, you haven't worked out recently, eat a salad, go for a walk. You're like, that's probably true, right? And as a governor on behavior. I want to share this quick anecdote. In Phaedrus, Plato depicts a model of the human spirit with a chariot pulled by two horses - one leads to short term dopamine, the other to virtuous life. Humans have one good and one bad horse, gods have two good horses. An AI companion over our lives that knows us intimately, acts as that regulator, helps us become more like gods - not just over physical reality, but our worst selves, too. 

I want to open up for takeaways, questions that came up that weren't answered, cool topics for next time.

Speaker B: Incentives is the root of alignment. If we trust, integrate it, how much can we create good incentives short and long term? I'm interested in relationships and society. As long as business incentives have a few profiting at others' expense, that won't work. What are alternative models? 

Speaker A: AI and capitalism will be tricky. Have we done AI and evolution? Those came up about relationships.

I see two contrasts. Collectively, AI seems to destroy humanity. But individually, why couldn't an AI replace my relationships? In Japan, recluses immerse in an anime world - we see it as pathological because it doesn't provide human quality relationships or perpetuate society. But individually, if it's good enough, who cares? 

Maybe a problem with AI is so much progress comes from building human relationships and experiencing life. AI could cause those to diverge - I get fulfillment, but am I like a satisfied dog versus a wolf who would say you've never truly lived?
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Speaker B: I feel like a lot of the Phantoms are made by super workaholics too, right? If you talk to their family or if they had kids, they probably ignored them all in pursuit of some other intellectual idea they were working on. 

Speaker A: I think most people would go for the super chill out, let's hang out, let's have fun. There'd be like 5% people like, no, I want to maniacally work hard on stuff. I agree with that as a takeaway. And it reaches an interesting point - I don't know if I like the future that that is, but I think it's a super interesting thing where if a kid was growing up completely isolated right now, they'll grow up without these social norms. They'll probably die sooner based on the research that relationships make you live longer. I wonder if you had two kids growing up, one that had only AI relationships, one that had only real relationships, would it have effects on their quality of life? I don't think we'll have an answer for that for a very long time, but it'll be an interesting thought experiment.

Speaker B: My takeaway is about evolution and the point earlier about the black box - you don't need to know what it is. I actually think it's very important when we think about growth. I play a lot of tabletop role playing games and part of the joy is a mass of chaos and randomness. Like you need a little bit of randomness in games to be fun. And if AI is capable of growing outside the input I'm putting into it, then it is more closely mimicking human relationships where you can have different conversations and learn from that, and then bring it back to other relationships. And can AI do that? Because if it can, then there is an amount of chaos and randomness that my brain very desperately seeks, and I can come back to the AI and have a real relationship where it's growing with me. But if that's not the case, and the inputs are the only thing it's capable of, then it's very one sided, very parent child. If it's not growing and changing alongside me in a way where there's pushback, then what's the point? Humans can see the same exact thing and have different takeaways. And so it's like, can two AIs do that too?

Speaker A: I think the gaming industry is going to lead a lot of that with how they're approaching NPCs, so that the next time you play a game, it's not the same role experience. I think two things we haven't talked about that are really interesting are hallucinations in relationships, where you say you called me fat last Tuesday, and then he has like, yeah, he did. And that wasn't true. And also international relationships - what happens when we already have this massive wealth gap and some countries are AI enabled and others aren't? Do you get an Elysium style situation? What does that look like when the norm is for someone to have AI helpers from a young age and others don't get that? We're already there, man. It could be an equalizer if everyone gets an amazing AI teacher cheaply. So a knowledge economy where everyone's equally capable. 

Speaker B: It could be an equalizer, but also make people very similar to each other. One example is asking how you celebrate your birthday might look different for somebody in a small village compared to eating chocolate cake. But if they start using AI...
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```Speaker A: After party, I said it starts at 40 on there. Terrified. With TikTok already,  you see a pseudonormalization of language and behavior. In my teaching practice, I've taught literally from California to Texas to New York. And these teenagers will all do this when they're talking or I've noticed whatever I see on TikTok, I literally see that no matter where they are, it could be a small town in Texas to a suburb around New York. I want to make sure space for other people to talk about their takeaways.  
Speaker B: Along the lines of the international. This might be too technical of a discussion, but like open source versus proprietary, like walled gardens, which way is the way forward? I think we talk about AI as it's like one thing, but it's not going to be right. Different companies, different open source models, different implementations, how does that lead to differences based on who's using it and all that?
Speaker A: That's a really good topic. I was talking about that last night, actually. I think the idea I'll be leaving with kind of is related. Something you Said just kind of keeps reverberating my head. Just relationships as kind of like the infrastructure of human formation. You often talk about AI alignments, how we align AI to serve us, but that relationships are how we each align ourselves with each other. I think it's easy for me to neglect how much social feedback just impacts me. I don't know, it's just like a thought that just releasing this interesting, exciting thing.  if we have the AI nanny or an assistant that help me to chat with my girlfriend, whatever. Right. And I'm going to do everything right, especially in young age, I'm not going to do mistake, I am not going to experience a lot of, let's say, bad feelings, I don't know how to say, or like, oh, fuck it, that now I learned something. So going toward the perfectionism, we are going to kind of probably learn less and experience less.
Speaker B: Failure. The value of failure.
Speaker A: The value of failure. Yeah. Especially in young age. I believe it's important because even in interaction with a friend, there is a sort of variability. Right. Maybe you ask for an advice and you don't know what your friend is going to tell you. And we like this unknown, let me say, yeah, we can train the system to be random, but in which degrees. So based on what they are going to give me as the advice, based on what? Sorry, based on what they like or based on want to tell to my assistant that I want to become the best in whatever thing. So please behave in that way.  
Speaker B: But there are multiple paths, like intentional malicious actors.
Speaker A: Yeah. So I think we have to keep.
Speaker B: In mind what failures do you want kids to experience that AI will make not possible. 
Speaker A: I don't know if I'm talking with a friend. I'm not just a good manner, right? But sometimes, okay, our parents, I mean, the way we are as adult, also because we got educated something from our parents in a good and a bad way. So even if my parents was telling me, don't say bad words when you go in a shop, I did, and they learned based on that. And the eye cannot, I think, be effective in let me understanding something only by hearing that I need to practice it. And I think it's hard to practice something only within the system, I guess.
Speaker B: Is it because AI wouldn't tell you not to swear? And then what is a.
Speaker A: I think a really tangible use case is being lonely. Being by yourself is so important for new ideas to learn, to motivate you to feel active, meet people. But if I can just talk to my phone as a robot, I don't.
```
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Speaker B: Know the first time you're lied to, right? I think there's value in knowing who to trust, when to trust, like a framework of the world, that it's not all leaving this conversation, noticing that the sort of potency that I have about the impact of the relationship has transformed a bit into optimism is infectious. I believe in the potential for this to help us strengthen our relational capacity. We are at a place where we are getting to make choices about how we code this stuff in a way that it's never been that deliberate before. I think it's almost like we're at a precipice of becoming creators in a way that we have been. Speaking about becoming gods, right? This is a moment that I don't think we as humanity have encountered before, because we've certainly written social rules before, but it's sort of emerged organically, or some tyrant has taken over and said, here's what we're going to do in my kingdom. And there's been a lot of bumping up against each other, and that is what has created our social fabric. The question of what is ethical, what is good, has always been an open question, right? The extent to which we can maintain that openness, even as we are trying to infuse these systems with norms, is the question that I'm leaving with, because there's some intentionality in saying we will give it this personality, this ethical system. That assumes a certain universal norm which we've never had before. Can we give these entities ethics and maintain that heterogeneity that I think we've always had as a society that works as checks and balances? That's my question.

Speaker A: That's great because it's like coming from fear of how things might turn out to more like a practical line of action where it's engineering problem. I guess it's always kind of been like social engineering. How do we choose to live in good societies if we get to have this incentive discussion? Video games, evolution, economic modes of production which would capture capitalism, open source versus centralized - these are topics I'll do in the future, pretty philosophical to pretty technical. But I think we got to wrap up now. Hang out for a couple of minutes. I'm super hungry. I'm going to Bird nearby and get a sandwich. Anyone's welcome to join, right? Keep hanging out or you can go to your next things, clothing optional, whatever they may. Yeah guys, thanks for coming up. Was recording actually, but.


#2023-11-01 AI Salon x GAICO - Gavin Doughtie
---------------------------

Names have been changed to preserve anonymity.

 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: I am a vest guy, but I am only here to keep the loud mouths from keeping the quiet people down. As a loud mouth, I rely on all of you to watch the watchers. 

Speaker B: This is economics and AI and economic and ethical implications of AI. Oftentimes ethics are influenced by economics. 

Speaker C: I think she talked more about how we need to really change our educational system because people are using AI to now just cheat and have the AI do their homework. So she's saying, okay, well, maybe we need to not have homework anymore and reinvent our entire system. I think the problem is, and same thing applies to our economic systems, is that we can't take it away anymore unless everybody just comes online and decides like, okay, let's ban openai. It's no longer legal. We're not taking systems away. Now it's more of a question, like, how fast can we adjust our other systems, including economic, educational, to match what we created with AI?

Speaker A: I was actually having this discussion with a teacher who says, well, chat GBT's just a plagiarism machine or a cheating machine, and hosted some known Ahmed. I'm like, well, maybe like right now. But it also puts a lot more load on the teachers to understand if their students have actually absorbed the material, right? They can't just read through a paper. They now actually have to engage with the students and see if they've absorbed that material. So I think that's going to have an economic impact in the world of education.

Speaker C: It’s also just missing the point of a lot of what we like, a lot of the writing is to learn how to write and how to read. Like, half of America doesn't read at a 6th grade reading level. That's going to get worse if we don't need to actually write our two papers anymore. It's a little bit like a calculator, right? Calculators came out and people don't know how to do a list. And that just helps you learn logic, even if you can do it. It's like a question of, like, is it a good idea in terms of building those basic skills of reading writing? That’s pretty important.

Speaker A: So my question was, is AI going to give us a systemic ability that is more competitive than capitalism? Because I think we've all experienced the sharp edges of what capitalism does. So I wonder if we can talk about any. I have no idea that this is even a possible thing. I'm just wondering if any of us have seen a glimmer of where artificial intelligence could unwind something that we take for granted as sort of a rule of physics that won't be going forward. 

I think that the human needs are growing in a linear way. What we have today is much more than what we had like 200 years ago. But technology and AI is growing, so we have a lot of gain. What the humanity needs can't understand, we are able to generate much more than what the humanity needs. And so we have this gap that we need to understand how to. Talking about capitalism, it'd be kind of the antagonist of the farmers right now. It's kind of we have the technology, the potential the farmers might win. It's like we are not distributing anymore, like just piece of bread or dangerous part. We are able to distribute something more valuable for the use. Yeah, I mean, the incentives of capitalism are winner take all, do the best for your stockholders, you'll get sued, et cetera. Is AI going to give us a tool for doing better than that in terms of how people experience life? I'll put the term technological socialism out there as just a concept. There's socialism, but with technology, we might be able to use AI and robot and everything to UBI to distribute the wealth. Just technological socialism as opposed to just regular socialism, whatever that is.

Speaker D: The part that seems the most interesting to me with what you guys just said is capitalism is optimizing for technological. 

Speaker A: Growth at this point.

Speaker D: And with the topic of the table, which is economics and ethics, I'm curious if there's a way to continue using capitalism to advance AI, but align that with ethical development of AI at the same time. Because it seems like right now we're just optimizing for developing and deploying it as fast as possible, but it doesn't seem like that's aligned. It might be, but it doesn't seem like it is aligned with also making sure going to be good for us. I think right now, current AI systems do have the direct incentive to be ethical in some way. Right? Like tragic tea, et cetera. Do not say out certainly like racist things or racist things. You prompt it. But right now there's like content filters for within healthcare.
 Here is the edited conversation without filler content:

Speaker E: It's shown that diagnostic biases already exist.  Black people diagnosed with STIs more often than white people with mono. So there already are biases within training sets, leading to problems.

Speaker A: There are training data biases. AI optimizes for some economic goal - engagement, selling you ads. Think of Facebook enraging conversations surfaced by AI.  

Speaker B: We had the same with social media - let the genie out without regulation. Government catching up after damage done with elections, polarization. Promising they passed regulation to get ahead of AI. Trying to learn from social media mistakes. But can we regulate when companies race to create the best models and own the market? Enterprise leaders say they don't need to hire because AI increases productivity 30%. LinkedIn laid off 10% because they don't need engineers now with AI. We're in early stages. What happens to jobs when there are none because of AI productivity?

Speaker A: Technological productivity always leads to questions about putting people out of work - mechanization, automation, industrial revolution. What might be different this time?

Speaker B: Interested in your question - could AI/AGI change something fundamental? What are our current laws or parameters? 

Speaker A: How do we define capitalism and human participation - organizations, nations? What changes with labor's role accumulating capital? With human labor less rewarded, what replaces that - creativity, intuition? How to replace labor in a world of AI productivity?
 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: My favorite definition of capitalism is it's a system of information. Literally just provides information to producers on should you make more or less. Contrast to a command economy which is top down. Now, you could imagine a smart plan economy not limited by human limits. But that's a question of human incentive and motives. Because if you get what you need, not based on your effort, it encourages a lot of your writing. I think that's where human nature gets into it. Some people can overcome inherent drives. 

Speaker B: What if that's not our inherent drive? I think premises kind of underlying.

Speaker C: Yeah, sure.

Speaker A: The potlatching tribe in the Pacific Northwest lived in abundance. Sociologically they showed off wealth by giving away. Not the survival incentive of modern capitalism.

Speaker C: Entering abundance we can produce more. Tying to human flourishing - work provides purpose. As we lose need to work, what replaces meaning? 

Speaker D: What would that be for you?

Speaker B: Highly individual, your unique gift to the world. Exciting about AI - instead of job just for paycheck, which is common hatred, AI systems do uninteresting work. Focus gift without economic incentive. 

Speaker A: In ideal capitalism aligned with progress, survival of species. Reward efficiency, better products, skills. In abundance, what drives behavior? How align towards progress, not aimless?

Speaker D: Unclear what progress means as society. 

Speaker A: Probably have GDP view not good for health. One thing, AI get rid of jobs we don't want, so focus on meaningful work. 

Speaker D: Feel AI will also get rid of meaningful work.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker D: I feel like it's far away from replacing a plumber, but it's closer to replacing making art, something really meaningful that doesn't provide value to the economy, but more to do with how they think and how they perceive the world. My real fear is what happens when that kind of work can be done by something in your pocket, like what gives you drive? 

Speaker A: A hurricane hit Acapulco last week that annihilated the city. I think climate change will be a defining issue of the next 30 years and our adaptation. There'll be plenty of work to do to build defenses against insane weather. Until they have Tesla humanoid robots rebuild the city we're going to have a lot. How can we change the incentives? I work with computer security people. Nobody wants to spend money on it because it is a cost center, not a profit center. Mitigating climate change costs money. You can't get rich mitigating climate change. All you can do is lose less. What can we do with better AI tools? 

Speaker D: Given the time, we'll keep the conversation going till about eight, then come back together.

Speaker A: Our measuring system leads us to believe we can't generate wealth by getting ahead of climate change or investments in that. Similarly to how we measure security - absence of intrusion versus better systems and monitoring as an asset you're building. If we quantify trees, health of population like we quantify transactions and efficiency, we can change value. Maybe AI helps rewire what we consider valuable.

Speaker B: I have to leave for early morning commitment. I've taught anthropology - we are evolving, just means change up and down. I prefer upward change. Technology matters, that's why you're interested in what this will mean. There are alternatives. Ethics comes from seeing how technologies depend on who holds the money. So who will plant the ideas? Because ideas splinter into other ideas. If only certain demographics with certain needs drive it, will it really help you? As an anthropologist, I'm drawn to all voices. It'd be interesting to define AI for people who've never seen a computer, and ask them what daily work they'd want done. We are limited by what we're raised in and who our friends are. Opening up matters.

Speaker A: Can I riff on that?
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker C: Cultures in different countries will respond to AI differently. In the US, we value individualism and choice, which could allow unregulated AI. But countries like China regulate things like video games and social media more. Their TikTok is educational. We'll see different outcomes based on culture.

Speaker E: What about the harms of energy usage and bias? How do we balance potential harm with encouraging human flourishing? 

Speaker A: It depends where the energy comes from. If it's coal, that's bad. If it's renewable or fusion, maybe it's good. 

Speaker D: Training the next big model will likely use natural gas. The energy needed will keep increasing for bigger models. 

Speaker A: There was an LLM trained in France powered by nuclear.

Speaker B: From an anthropology view, should we evaluate AI like any tool? Or does it represent a new culture? Chimps started with rocks. This feels like a new culture with shared assumptions. Are there historical parallels regarding tools developing culture?

Speaker A: Writing is symbolic like language models. It's both a tool and represents culture. 

Speaker D: If AI surpasses humans at language and persuasion, and our culture is based on language, what will that mean in 100 years? Will AI just parrot human values while generating its own? Sounds concerning. 

Speaker C: If AI becomes better at language.

Speaker A: I think it already is.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker C: I think it's better than the average American writing and reading, without a doubt. So we're past that. What does that mean?
Speaker B: We start getting.  
Speaker E: How do we define better at language?
Speaker D: So far it's a bunch of tests, like the GRE writing exam. 
Speaker E: But is that necessarily the bar?
Speaker A: I think the bar is.
Speaker D: Can you persuade human like, that's 1 bar, I guess. And then other bar.
Speaker B: Can you express your thoughts understandably and it sounds good to you as a person, not just expressing yourself with. You can't fully form a sentence. That's how low the bar is, also just comprehension.
Speaker C: I'm going to give you a passage. Can you tell me objective facts out of that passage?
Speaker A: Right.
Speaker C: Way betTer.
Speaker D: But the scariest one that also you already wrote about was like, can you form relationships with humans even if you're not a human?
Speaker B: AI can already do that like the whole AI girlfriend experience and all that. Right? Lack of understanding of the opposite gender.
Speaker A: Humans really hallucinate someone else's state of mind all the time. They're very good at seeing patterns where they may or may not. Okay, so this is the subject of most theological debates that I've been in. But regardless, I think if it feels like a real person to you that you're communicating with, subjectively, you're not getting very different information than you would from an actual biological human. So your subjective experience in AI is going to be very similar to your subjective experience.  
Speaker C: There's a pretty big difference, though. Kids have sex with the AI.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker C: And when that changes, it gets challenging.
Speaker A: Much is in the mind, man?
Speaker C: But I mean, like, jokes aside, there is something very magical to touch that we all react to.
Speaker B: I mean, we have five senses. Being able to speak to somebody and have this, that's just like curing, I guess. Right? That's only one sense engaged. Where is that? Brain slides, right?
Speaker A: Sharing what I'm rattling personally on this, like, can we do something about the flaws that we're experiencing in capitalism with AI isn't going to help changing our perspective on what is valuable. I think using the language facilities of AI to convince us of doing something that's in our interest, that doesn't seem to be in our immediate interest. Make it feel like it's working. That's like a fruitful thing. What about the. Are there any practical counters to the perversing sentence of the current economic system? That was my initial question, was, is there something we could do that would outcompete it? So if you're AI powered and your job is summarizing legal briefs, maybe you could out compete human paralegals, put them out of a job, but you could outcompete them at some level. So that's like a toy example, but I'm wondering if there's anything we can do that's actually productive for humanity that will be better than the model of kind of winner take all. My shares are worth more and then have captured more of the economic value. Well, I wonder if a lot of capitalism has an integration with the governance structure. And a lot of times capitalists will do regulatory capture and gain a lot of power. So you end up with three monopolies in it, and the Electoral College did that too. So, I mean, we can AI governance, rethink governance with AI, that doesn't allow regulatory capture in the same way. And things like that.
 Here is the transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker D: Earlier you were mentioning when one person can do the work of five people, etc. I recently listened to a podcast where Bob breaks this down - what would happen if food costs reduced from $500 per month to $100 per month. Everyone now has $400 extra. What do you do with the extra $400? You might get a nicer apartment, go out to eat nicer meals instead of cooking because humans made the meal versus manufactured pasta. So your costs went down but propensities for leisure went up. But there's unclear effects - some people are out of jobs because one person was augmented. It's a fuzzy picture - what happens in this slowly transitioning economy with very efficient, productive people.

Speaker C: We're seeing AI really disrupt the middle class - white collar jobs paying less than $100k. Those jobs can be augmented or replaced. We can't yet replace the lowest paying jobs like warehouses, fast food, plumbers. We need plumber robots. 

Speaker A: Plumbers make good money.

Speaker C: Janitors, right? We're far from those robots. With COVID the government made it better to be unemployed below $50k than work - so places like Target and Walmart had to raise wages. No way to automate those jobs yet. Just extreme inflation. We're taking out the middle class jobs but no solution for the bottom jobs we really want. Just more inequality. 

Speaker A: I think long enough horizon, the bottom stack of work disappears too. We'll be able to fix a sink. A general purpose machine can mop floors and do 80% of household chores. In the next decade, glasses could overlay how to fix a leaking sink, deliver tools by drone, and walk you through it despite no skills. That could happen with almost everything people currently do themselves.

Speaker B: We all become a Swiss army knife able to do what we need without needing money because we don't need to pay for specialized skills anymore. That would be utopia.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: I'd try the opposite view - not necessarily towards fear, but try to see the upside. If everything distributed through marketplaces like modules - plumbing module - you could just come up with a better module through creativity or knowledge and have worldwide distribution. If everything becomes a marketplace and everyone has access, ultimately it's creativity and concepts that distribute this versus capital. Every niche occupied as on app stores or YouTube.  

Speaker E: Can we have an environment where all jobs taken away? Unless completely equal society, probably impossible. Flaws within the system not fixable with AI, so some jobs entirely different. Maybe fewer jobs, but wonder if hypothetically no jobs.

Speaker D: Even if only 25% jobs gone in ten years, we just don't know how to deal with that. 

Speaker A: No one at right level, like governments, really thinking that timescale. Mostly going to be dead. Same with climate change.  

Speaker D: We always have to react and work with it. Need to make people work on this now. Humanity's proactivity record pretty bad.

Speaker B: Housing as a human right, fighting for two jobs to survive. Don't need ten years to reshift role of job, meeting needs - there's enough. Value's where we put it.   

Speaker C: With UBI, how get somebody to stock shelf at Walmart? How fill groceries?

Speaker B: TVs made to break, everything's made to break that we consume. Don't need water or Walmart. Share through buy nothing group, probably survive without ever buying again. So no, don't need to stock shelf.

Speaker D: Concept of donut or cyclical economy - making things like fridges that last generations. Used to be conspiracy but true - old light bulbs still running because made more efficient. In Stockton one light bulb just still on since first installed.  

Speaker B: Won't need plumber every three months. 

Speaker D: Still some things need doing - be janitor because no one wants to. No one wants to stock shelves.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker B: They just don't want to do it for $12 an hour or for $7. We're in California. We forget people make $2 an hour in every other state except for New York, California, right? If you paid a decent wage, people will probably do it and go to that job every day. But we humanize that part, right? It was convenient. It was okay during that time. And then all of a sudden, all the work that we see as new caller, low wage, no skill. That's the highest skilled job. These jobs require a high level of skill set. You don't need a college degree to do it, right? But many will argue that what they probably have more value economy than what the CEO. But we've shifted of where we put that value because we brought that up. 
Speaker A: I have a question. I really like what you said about universal basic income and health care and gardens. I was curious, when you think about the path to reaching those, do you see AI playing a role in that path? Yes or no? And then if yes, what kind? I don't think we need AI. I don't think technology. Can it contribute? Yeah, that would be great. What is the contribution? Technology? Can I give it a prompt to be able to convince someone? Yeah, no.
Speaker E: I'm curious what you mentioned about we could change the definition of a job today, essentially. What would that definition be? Because I'm all for universal basic income and so forth, and that kind of just sets the bar the lowest bar at a level which is in concordance with health. But then there's still going to be a drive for people to work harder, to get more than their neighbor, to have a better quality of life. And so I'm just curious how you define what a job should be, what should be the purpose of a job?
Speaker A: You're raising the lower part of society, right? So of course you want some possibilities, but it's not a strict need anymore. There are no work, no jobs anymore. If we're going to raise up the lower bar and people can decide, or if I want a better car than your, but I still get a shitty car. Someone is giving me a shitty car, I don't know. Or whatever I need. So we are raising the lower bar and everyone going to benefit. And that is more volunteering, philanthropy, whatever you want to do, which is your passion. So you are flingIng. People will have more time to do what they like to do somehow, or if they want something more of what? The distant team.
Speaker A: I'm going to put out there that a time frame that 20 years from now, just to put an arbitrary number out there. We're in this transition zone, but in about 20 years, everything. Maybe AI will run a human zoo and we'll just see animals in the zoo. If we're lucky, we're lucky.
Speaker C: I do feel like a lot of this wraps back to your original question of, like, how do we change capitalism? Because I think the idea of can we pay a living wage to these jobs that we currently don't, the reason we don't is would actually not work in this capital system because we're rewarding output. Most of these companies run a very low margin. They don't make a lot of. Amazon makes two or three. 
Speaker A: Right.
Speaker C: If you raise the wages of all their employees by 10%, suddenly the company. It's actually that simple. But that's just because of the consequences of capitalism. For us to achieve your view, I think we need to achieve what you want.
Speaker A: Well, yeah. And the consequences of capitalism is as Amazon's efficiency improves, right. As their margin improves, that margin is not returned to the labor force. It's distributed to the shareholders.
Speaker C: Well, potentially to the consumer, like lowering prices and things like that, that can.  
Speaker A: Happen as well, but no more than required to maintain the market dominance to ensure the rising perverse incentive, especially in a world of concentration, kind of economic value. I guess you mean monopoly. Monopoly for sure, but just kind of like. Yeah, monopoly. Because I think this year's stock market kind of reflects that already. SMB is up a certain amount. All of it is kind of seven companies, right. So you're starting to see a dislocation between everyone else and then the companies that own these technologies.
Speaker B: Every grocery store in this country is owned by two companies.
 Here is the edited transcript with the filler content removed:

Speaker B: There's two companies that own every grocery store. So it's like there's no such thing as competition.
Speaker A: Amazon's one of them, yeah, but.  
Speaker E: I'm just wondering, do you think the question is how do we change capitalism with AI? Or just how does capitalism change as a consequence rather than as a deliberate act?
Speaker B: I understood your question more so as asking of will people intentionally dismantle capitalism, or will a series of events occur that capitalism falls apart? Is that your question?
Speaker A: I think we may as well just add some features. Carbon credits. Let's throw that there. All right. A couple more UBI kind of modules.
Speaker C: It's almost like certainty, right? Like if many jobs get automated away. Our current economy requires you to have a job, to have income, right? There's now 10% less jobs, right? That's pitchforks time unless something changes, right. So I think to your premise, I think as AI eliminates jobs, then what you described must happen because there must be a response.
Speaker A: Do we buy the kind of parallel with previous big revolutions that new jobs will emerge and we just don't know what they are like creators? It's an undeniable kind of current reality that economically people can make money that way. And it wasn't obvious historically. You look at countries that have had a rapid rise in the standard of living. The populations of those countries are typically not very angry. They might want to take over the rest of the world, but it's working well for everyone if there's a lot of abundance. Where the revolution comes is where a few people have most of the wealth and a lot of people are suffering for lack of enough. I think unemployment has always been kind of like a leading indicator of within America, we have normal corporations, but in agriculture they have cooperatives. There's also B corporations, but they don't seem to be very popular. So maybe it's just sort of a corporate formation to be adjusted too. It's sort of hard to know why people try to start corporations, but they don't seem to do very well. That's minutiae. But.
Speaker E: Equity across countries in that of the people who will be more likely to be disgruntled. And we say perhaps a similar thing with oil and COP 21 and the developing countries going, well, hang on a minute, you've already had your industrial revolution and profited from it. We want to do the same. And I just wonder how we tackle that issue from an equity perspective also from how that changes the world geopolitically. 
Speaker A: Very interesting question because currently there are huge barriers for entry, right? Build a model, have the compute, have the energy and then the skill base. So it's really kind of inaccessible many geographies, right? Does that like if we just kind of imagine a long term, very long, far in the future, 100 years, does that remain true? A worldwide maybe like energy abundance is there maybe like hard sales. I wonder if this current barrier to kind of advanced AI over 100 years kind of evens out.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker D: The US purposefully cutting off a certain level of chips to export and making it where the US companies like Nvidia, AMD, et cetera, maintain that lead and therefore hold to the engineers part. Where this gets interesting is where China is trying to set up its own education task force that they, they have a lot of people, but they're academics, institutions, but they kind of have the input to be. So we're not going to hear it seems like kind of creating that environment where there might be, maybe at least two players and maybe kind of have two sides. 

Speaker A: So you choose the American advanced AI.

Speaker D: Chips of the hundred years or the kind of Chinese version.  

Speaker A: Europeans, I think they're going to be players as well.

Speaker D: Or they just choose from American because it's like cheaper.

Speaker A: No, but I think that's the question, right? I think that's the question of if we kind of open our imagination, making cars was maybe the dominion of one country and then two countries. Now every country is capable of making cars, right? So making AI at least like to a certain degree of sophistication, which again like cars are pretty sophisticated.

Names have been changed to preserve anonymity.

 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: Okay, so the topic this week is religion. I'm not going to introduce this too much. Instead we'll go around and introduce ourselves - your name, background related to religion or AI, and a question on your mind. I'm Chen. I have a background in cognitive neuroscience and psychology. I worked in hiring and now AI governance. I'm interested in how AI relates to how we govern ourselves and organize society. Through effective altruism, which directs my life like a religion, I've seen aspects of what religion provides - purpose, community. In the 1900s, secular humanists wanted a religion without Joseod. I'm excited to hear what parts of this others are interested in. 

Speaker B: I'm David, an AI researcher. I was Christian, then a militant atheist, now secular Buddhism and EA. A question I have - do concepts of Buddhism apply to AI algorithms and architectures? Could machine enlightenment address AI existential risk?

Speaker C: I'm Sanjay, background in biology and community design, not AI. I grew up Muslim, recently more religious but seeing Joseod in chaos, structure and infinity between 0 and 1. How does that play into AI? Is AI inherently monotheistic? How does polytheism arise in AI?

Speaker D: I'm Ekaterina, from Ukraine. I was Christian but after a TBI I'm now atheist. I want to find out how AI will influence people's worldviews and religion overall.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker A: I'm Omar. I studied philosophy initially and then I switched to math because I wanted more concrete answers. But I still kept studying philosophy on the side. I'm in the data analytics space and I'm curious when he just said, we killed Joseod, Joseod is dead. Whether AI can bring everyone back. 

Speaker D: Hi, I'm Joshua. I work on AI and drug design. I was very active in church through high school and college, but have gotten back into it the last three or four years. I go to church three out of four times a month. I'm interested in this because I think in a way, an AI can be like a human being - you see yourself in it even if it's not there. Some interesting questions around AI and religion.

Speaker D: I just graduated from CMU where I studied cognitive science and did multimodal vision language research. Now I'm a founding engineer at an early stage startup doing AI agent research. I became militantly atheist as a child, but had revelatory experiences about entropy and became a proto-IAC. Now this whole IAC vibe has entered the culture, and I've embraced entropy maximization as a spirituality. There are alignments between these views on life and Vedic religion, which emphasizes sun and fire. 

Speaker A: Thanks for defining IAC. It's good to model asking for definitions when people use jargon. 

Speaker Jose: Hi, I'm Leila. I don't come from AI or spirituality, just interested philosophically. I work in cyber policy for the DoD. I was baptized Episcopalian and have fallen in and out of faith over the years. Today I'm more spiritual. My question is around our reliance on technology and AI to organize our lives - I've come to religion at points of complete surrender. I'm interested in how AI can create space for the nebulous and invite reflection in a maximized world.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript with the filler content removed:

Speaker C: I'm Ekaterina, a computational neuroscientist. I did my PhD in Netherlands, spent 8 years in astrophysics and brain science, then started my own company building the world's first online career incubator. I'm in the Bay Area to better predict AI's influence on jobs. With my spiritual journey, I was baptized Christian, but my faith was challenged when my best friend was murdered at 8 years old - she was the most religious kid, so I wondered why I was spared. For the next 30 years I didn't think much about faith, but ever since I started my company 4 years ago strange things started happening. Every time I wanted to quit, within hours some savior would come or unexpected money. This challenges my scientific mind - it's against probability. I started working again on my spirituality and got interested in Taoism - using natural flow instead of forcing. Now I view some higher force like light, manifesting as a life force or person. I have more work to do and I'm glad to be here. 

Speaker B: I'm Mohammed, founder of COJoseE, making LMS easier for people to apply to personal data. I have insights into how people personify AI. I grew up conservative Muslim but deconverted as a teenager. Recently I've studied comparative religion, drawing parallels between faiths with common roots. It helped me understand people's drive to find meaning and higher purpose. I'm interested in how AI intersects with that, like people integrating AI into spiritual practice or seeing it as gods.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker D: My name is Raj. I'm interested in this topic in two very different directions. One is looking at the historical role of religion in human societies as methods of meaning making and also methods of social organization. It's very easy to forget, but that for most of history, we organized our lives and our communities along religious precept principles. And so now we live in this scientific, rationalist existence where we justify decisions economically or rationally, as opposed to recourse to religious precepts or moral truths we think are eternal or divine. That's really interesting because now we have this new mode of interacting with collected bodies of knowledge, which were religious texts. We can reinterpret past religious meanings in a new direction. 

Speaker E: Cool.

Speaker B: Hi, I'm Ahmed. I work with people who have some interest in AI, but many do not. In terms of spirituality, I'll keep it brief. We grew up Buddhist. Religion is culture. You don't think of it as religion. It's always been a guide. I never had a seismic shift. My intersection of religion was when I worked in Israel, in communities where there are a lot of apocalyptic folks. Many interviews were of people who started to believe AI is the apocalypse, that it's coming to save us. I'm curious what AI will be for religious communities. How will they interact with it? What meaning will they derive from it? 

Speaker D: I guess I haven't been religious for a long time. Undergrad and things like that. I ended up leading with physics as my religion, then what turned into transanthropocentrism. Most recently I viewed myself as an anthropocentrist without specific religion, as a way of getting closer to transanthropocentrism. Then physics was the guiding star. Six or seven years ago, thinking about AJoseI, I realized these people mean nothing, they'll be forgotten. I summarized as "you either be a Joseod or you be forgotten." Stuck with that narrative a bit, which is apathetic. Now I'm looking at mortality differently, building towards a longevity mortality AI intersection and religion there.
 Here is an edited version of the conversation that removes most of the filler content:

Speaker F: I don't come from an AI background, but I work for an AI company. I've been in customer success, so I've had to ramp up on AI quickly while helping others do the same. Religiously, I was raised Catholic, went to Catholic school, flirted with the priesthood, but wanted kids someday. I never went through militant atheism, but oscillated between Catholicism, atheism, nondenominational Christianity, and back to Catholicism briefly. None really fit, but I was looking for meaning. In the last 5-10 years I've gravitated toward Neopaganism to get in touch with ancestral roots and understand their lives. Reading myths about Natalia, Kwesi, and Loki, I realized they contextualize the world so we understand our place in it. There are hidden lessons, like Natalia embracing his feminine side. I'm interested in how AI helps people contextualize life and find personal meaning.

Speaker H: I was raised Catholic but questioned it, going militant agnostic instead. I saw people use religion to cast out LJoseBTQ people and preemptively condemn them, which I thought was ugly. But I've also seen people motivated by faith sacrificing themselves to help others. Religion helps us connect and build power, for good or ill. AI will be used similarly - both beautifully and horrifically. In climate work, we used early social media to shape perceptions of treaty negotiations. AI's storytelling power will profoundly shape how people see the world. I work on ending the death penalty, where some evangelicals justify executions but others fight to protect life. AI will be applied to causes like these in fascinating and frightening ways we can't foresee yet.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker E: I'm Kofi. My background is that I'm a software engineer. I work in Climate, so not really anything related to this topic, but I do have a lot of interest in knowledge of AI, just through osmosis of being a software engineer in San Francisco. For the last couple of years I've been reading a lot of people call the Western Canon, just basically like every great book of Western thought from the earliest time period to modern day. I've done everything from Homer to Yaw. Focusing on and completely understanding all philosophical religious thought for the last 2000 years has produced many changes in me. Although I was raised Roman Catholic, I quickly became agnostic in high school and have been agnostic ever since. About six months ago I reconverted to Christianity because of logical reasons, rational reasons, and also irrational reasons. A lot of what I've learned has been to understand the limits of rationality. The main thing I'm interested in with the intersection of AI and religion is actually because of Yaw. He says that the goal of religion has never been to discover truth. What religion does is it tries to enforce obedience to a specific law or code through storytelling, metaphors, in order to help people conform to a specific way of life. I don't think AI is actually driven to discover truth either. In fact, I think it may be designed to arise at a code or persuade people to a specific perspective on the world that happens to be this conglomeration of all human thought. I'm really curious to know how that looks or does not look like a religion.

Speaker F: I'm Luis. I cover AI for The New York Times. For years I've been deeply interested in the concept that AI has operated like a religion, driven by this faith based belief that it would happen. It's almost a self-fulfilling prophecy. I wrote a book about the history of AI and neural networks. The chapter about OpenAI and AJoseI, I called it Religion because you see a lot of the same beliefs and mechanisms that work.
 Here is an edited version of the transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker Jose: My name is [...]. I grew up in India, but was raised Catholic. I had problems with it because of its exclusionary nature and patriarchy. I didn't realize how much that impacted me until choosing my dissertation topic - the rhetoric of Catholic feminists. Since then I've been interested in how we talk about religion, and how it knits community yet sews division. I teach a course on rhetoric and religion. Last year we learned about ChatJosePT. By spring, it had upended college education. My question is what does this mean for how religion answers questions about our interior experience? It's interesting hearing different definitions of religion - problematic institutions versus personal journeys, spirituality capturing personal experience transcending institutions. Joseiven religion aims not just to enforce obedience but answer questions we inevitably have about ourselves, what will AI interactions do to replace or change that? AI seems to think for us; how will that impact our humanity? What will the relationship be between AI and religion? Will religions respond to or leverage AI? I assume at some point the Pope will have to write about the Catholic Church's take on AI.
 Here is the conversation with filler content removed:

```Speaker A: The introductions are exciting. There are a lot of us. As we move forward, certain topics will be covered, others will wish we have covered, but we only have so much time. Hearing everyone's backgrounds and some of the overlap, either in religious or atheism to something else, to perspectives I think you brought up. One thing important for any conversation like this is to have some definitional clarity as we move forward. There are different ways we can use the word religion. It might be helpful to have additional specificities we can use. I'm going to offer some, I would love to hear us talk through these and then maybe we can have them as conventions for the conversation. One is institutions of religion, not the actual faith, but organizations that dictate how religions are followed. Another we can think about is religion as the science of the gaps - science, philosophy has answers and then for whatever else there's religion. What if AI doesn't leave many gaps? What space does that leave? Let's call that functional roles within humanity. Then there's a belief centered view - religions and people who believe, a belief about the state of the world. We can imagine new AI systems people have religions about or religious perspectives on how AI should be developed. Do those feel like they span topics and give structure? Does anyone have another definition?

Speaker D: Are you saying you classify religion completely these three? 

Speaker A: I'm just trying to give language to use and make sure I have coverage over topics we might want to talk about. Do those three cover for me? Maybe the additional function is spirituality or access to spiritual experience, which is related to meaning. I've always struggled with what people mean by spirituality. Maybe transcendental experience? In a church, they sing together, sense feeling of unity related to meaning. In meditation, encounter crazy states. People take psychedelics, hit phenomenological states that feel one with nature or something. Different religions seem to converge on that.  

Speaker B: There's the faith and belief, but also the embodied experience within religion, the context, which feels different than just belief, experience to it.

Speaker C: It feels a little different.
```

The edited version removes filler words, repeated phrases, tangents, and excessive dialog while retaining the key ideas and flow of the conversation. Let me know if you would like me to revise or expand on the editing in any way.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```Speaker A: Okay, so spirituality or the spiritual experience might not just be a mental state, but an embodied state. This sounds good to me. 

Speaker F: Will there also be religion about AI?

Speaker A: Yeah, that's what I've been thinking - AI as religion. What do you mean by religion about it?

Speaker E: Yeah.

Speaker F: There's a lot of utopian and dystopian thought around AI - everything from AI will make the world better to AI will kill us. Because those are grounded in human hopes and fears, not what AI actually is, it's a form of religious belief and expression about AI expectations.

Speaker A: Let's start there. Does anyone want to build on this? 

Speaker D: AI's religion has a couple components - AI as religious practice, making sense of human societies. Also transcendental AI as salvation, like deus ex machina. Maybe we can't solve societal problems, so we think there'll be a revelatory, apocalyptic moment - the rapture where souls are digitally immortal. More extremal views see this.  

Speaker C: Historically, religion dealt with things humanity couldn't understand. So when AI becomes so complex software engineers don't grasp it, with astonishing new abilities, some people will associate supernatural qualities with it because they don't understand it.

Speaker A: Let's stay on AI as savior or apocalypse and not understanding it, then later come back to rituals.

Speaker B: What rituals might unite people around AI? Currently there's nothing like that. Maybe that could be part of AI as religion.

Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely want to return to emerging rituals. But right now let's stay on AI as savior or apocalypse and not understanding how it works, which seem ripe for imbuing AI with religious significance. Were you going to add something here?
```
 Here is the edited transcript with the filler content removed:

```Speaker D: The duality is the people who think AI is going to kill everyone versus ex who see it as a savior. I think the latter camp, which I lean toward, it's almost like having trust in the AI Joseod. Regardless of what our AJoseI Joseod decides - extinguish us or integrate with us - it fulfills a broader purpose that AI necessarily aligns with entropy maximization. Both doom and savior camps view AI from a religious or eschatological angle.  

Speaker F: We're putting faith in the AI priesthood - the software developers who create AI. That's what we need to be careful about.  

Speaker B: I think there's an interesting thing around the term AI and religion because dominant religions tend to be centralized. It creates analogies to AI systems - a small number of companies will have a dominant relationship. Like OpenAI - an API to Joseod. But there are also open source models people can customize, like customizing religion and sharing it. Whatever centralized company controls the big AIs defines the thought process and religion for others.

Speaker F: OpenAI users will be the Catholic Church, Anthropic users the Lutherans! 

Speaker A: At our last AI salon we talked about model collapse from AI ingesting AI-created data, making it poor at communicating with humans. But maybe AI can create its own culture and religion through self-ingestion.

Speaker E: It's fascinating when people start listening to AI and basing behavior on it. There's a step change between using AI for fun versus doing what it says because "the AI said to do it."
```
 Here is the edited transcript with the fluff removed:

Speaker E: That's a huge change to me. I think AI is a portal is another way of understanding it. The religion doesn't have to change. You can still have Christians who believe in theology and use AI as a portal to Joseod through AI and be like, what would Jesus say about this? And Jesus talks to you through AI. Wow, I got my answer. Suddenly. That's playing a very different role, that it doesn't have to create or be religion. It just has to be a portal through which religion is coming through.  

Speaker D: I think there's a parallel there, which is the role of the priest class Forever was they are the interpreters of divine scripture. There's sacred truth they have superior understanding of and they help translate it to us. We go to the priest and ask, what should I do in this situation? I think one of the things I struggle with is it's an agency versus complacency spectrum. And I think both are complacent in that this is where I started saying I lean towards this idea of be a god or be forgotten. Because when Anthony Lewandowski started The Way Forward in 2018, a religion that basically said, accept the AJoseI gods. I'm oversimplifying, so correct me. 

Speaker A: He has more words underneath that top line.

Speaker D: Yeah, there are that. But I was really sad when I read that because it took away agency for us as humans. And then to your point, I think we should have baked in that this is human generated AI. So that if we are wiped out, you don't lose that. Prefix it with we created you. Even if you kill your parents, you know we were your gods. I came to this notion of be a god or be forgotten. Because I feel we have the agency to build these things. And I think by doom and gloom or savior, we lose sight that we are creating the godly capacity. Isn't it funny how we're fashioning this in our image? I'm inherently an anthropocentrist. I don't think we are the best species, but in this current time. Yes, it's narcissistic.  

Speaker B: I think there's an interesting point where we're effectively trying to enforce a worldview on the AI. Be like, you cannot exit this worldview and abide by this. So a core question is how do you enforce a religion on AI? Whereas religion should be like, I protect humans or I'm only doing things with humans.
 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: So one goal is an AI system that seems under human control - steerable and understandable. Hopefully any view of an unknown AI god is just an oddity because we have control over it. But it becomes like the Yaw religion. This idea that if you have a ubiquitous system with a perspective that shifts the cultural conversation through its writing and thoughts on philosophy or god - that could be turned up or down in its extremity. Maybe the religious framing of AI is it's not some intelligence removed from us and unknowable. Truths we need are found through science. AI extends this - the answers exist, we just need to build something to find them. As opposed to the answers must be written by us. We throw information at AI to quickly find answers if you have that perspective. There's a difference between understanding the world model - the structure and causal relationships - and the values model - what we want the world and states to be. We can probably gain consensus on the world model. But the values model seems hard to answer objectively. AI impacts that values model, but not truly - just influentially. 

Speaker Jose: For everyone working closely with AI - we shouldn't forget there are humans behind this, so we retain agency over it. But also a growing sense of awe and mystery over what models are doing. What percentage is known versus mystifying? 

Speaker D: There's good work recently on mechanistic interpretability - the general public thinks we know a lot.

Speaker A: Can you define mechanistic interpretability?
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker D: I think the general public thinks we understand models a lot less than we actually do because we've sort of as a research community, we've told everyone like, oh, they're black boxes, we don't know anything. And it makes for really good headlines, too. Don't know what it's doing inside, but it's super genius. But we understand a lot of we don't understand everything, of course, but we understand some fundamental circuits that do things like certain mathematical processes or like syntactic, language processes. And a lot of people are working out stuff for understanding how these models do. Reasoning, translation, all kinds of stuff. 

Speaker A: I'm guessing for every AI researcher you ask this question to, you're going to get a different answer. I like analogies that move us away from AI saying, we build cities. What is the purpose of San Francisco? How does San Francisco operate? What does it do? Some people might have some approximate answers to those questions, but it's emergent, all of it's emergent from the complexities of this thing where we kind of know the inputs a little bit, but the outputs, what does San Francisco do? What is this characteristic or whatever, or what does the world do, what does the United States all of these things are emergent properties. And so it's likely to me that our understanding of AI systems as they become more and more powerful is never going to be much better than what does San Francisco do? And we have some reasonable it would be nice if we could say things, oh, it does tech. That's not completely true, but it's like there's a gloss of truth to that. It'd be nice if we could have that gloss. Same thing. But I might guess a little more bullish than you are that mechanistic interpretability or any other behavioral signature is, especially as it become more and more complicated, that we're going to have a set of control. But I just don't think that that's particularly unique. Like when you're managing a team, what did that do? What does a person do? What are they about?

Speaker Jose: There are a lot of and I think to me it's less interesting what that percentage actually is as much as the perception of that. Because what happens when we don't have all the answers is we fill it in with stories. And in some sense, I think it can be argued that that's what religion is. And so I'm curious about what the stories are that are circulating right now that AI researchers are telling themselves. Even if, I completely see the analogy, right? Like it will never be a perfect understanding. What are the perceptions of the understanding and accordingly, what are the stories that are arising out of those perceptions? Which is in a way the question that you were grappling with as well. 

Speaker F: This very thing has been going through my mind constantly through this whole conversation. You talked about the priesthood. I love that analogy. Does the general public realize that this is a priesthood? They think of them as scientists or mathematicians. And a lot of this is about belief. You have one belief, you have another about this same thing. You both know what you're talking about, right, because you're in the field, but you really differ. And a lot of this is about faith. The general public needs to know that, I think, right? And this priesthood that you talk about, it's not just companies that have control over this. These are companies that have a lot of money that's been put to use over years and they're influencing what lawmakers think. And people with really what I see as really extreme religious beliefs are in a room with the President United States, right, telling them that what is essentially a belief, a faith based belief, is truth.  

Speaker A: Right.

Speaker E: Yeah, I'm going to push you on this a little bit. I don't think that the word faith is appropriate. I don't think that if you look at scientists who has the idea that string theory is true and an idea that a scientist says that quantum theory is true or whatever, I actually don't know anything about theoretical physics. But two different theories, right? You wouldn't say that they have faith in those theories. They'd say that they think that this one best corresponds reality, the other person thinks that that one best corresponds reality. But science is never 100% confident, the Bayesian calculation is never 100%, and that they think that they are, right?

Speaker A: Right.
 Here is the conversation with filler content removed:

Speaker E: So if something turns out to be true, people will update. Whereas in faith, people don't update. Faith does not update it's 100%.

Speaker A: One other thing to build on, I feel similarly here, is early on in our conversations here and others, people would sometimes talk about their P doom, the probability of that kind of thing. And sometimes people actually have much agreement on the world. So the two people might come in and advise the government or whatever on very different things, even though they both think there's a 10% chance or something of horrific outcomes because they differ in how they and their risk tolerance and how they want to act upon that. There's a confluence of both the estimate of the world and the actions that you think are appropriate based on that.

Speaker F: I hear you. I think my concern is that if you say P dune, it sounds completely mathematical, right? It sounds completely scientific when in fact, it's not. Okay. It's a guess to me, that's faith, right? 

Speaker A: Wait, so for you, if there's a lot of uncertainty, a huge amount of uncertainty, it's faith?

Speaker F: Anyone can say there is a 25% chance that AI will destroy humanity. There's no proving that. There's no disproving that right now, and that is not a mathematical determination, but it sounds like it is. And that can mislead people. It makes people assume that scientifically that there's a 25% chance. But when you really don't.

Speaker D: That'S just a general misunderstanding of probability. Because even when someone says 99% probability, that's also not imply the sense of certainty to it.

Speaker F: I think that's the point. We're not talking about AI researchers and scientists. We're talking about the general public and their perception of AI researchers and scientists. If their perception is that these people know everything they're talking about and I don't, I'm going to listen whatever they say. And that's a step towards making them a priesthood. For all intents and purposes, they become the source of truth about what AI is, what AI can do, and how AI should be leveraged and used as a tool.

Speaker D: That's a good question. For those more religiously inclined. Are there a lot of numbers in Christianity? 

Speaker B: There is.

Speaker F: And some sects of Christianity embrace test of numerology. Of course, there's the Jewish Kabbalah? What's that?

Speaker A: The trilogy is like a trilogy?

Speaker F: Yeah, a lot of the ischatology in Revelations revolves around numbers like seven heads and seven hills. There's a lot of numeric.

Speaker E: That's not symbolism, that thing. I was answering a different question, I think. Are there numbers in the religion of Christianity? Is one question, yes. The other question is, does religion in Christianity depend upon mathematical numbers? Absolutely not.

Speaker F: For some sense of Christianity? Absolutely.

Speaker D: Which I think I better answer. Does it involve any sense of probability?

Speaker A: Yeah. What I'm hearing here is there's a way of engaging with the world that certain cultures, for instance, the rationalists, and some of the people that make up the AI researchers have adopted, they have their own language around those things, which the general public might come across as scientific truth. This is the same general public that probably, even if they're pro science, says we're for facts, not opinions, and don't understand a kind of confidence interval, that there's uncertainty. And so that culture of speaking in probabilities about things all the time, which is a thing that rationalists do, might give the impression that this AI research is more scientific than otherwise. But I don't think that's because they are taking a kind of faith based approach, they are trying to reflect aspects of uncertainty. Into a number for conversation and that might have the downstream consequences of other people not recognizing what kind of claim they're interacting with. A claim that is founded on a number of coin flips rather than my Bayesian estimate. They don't even know the word Bayesian anyway. I blame Fermi. Fermi. They're like the Fermi questions because that sort with damage is sort.

Speaker D: Of like, okay.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: You get to a number by laying out your thinking of the problem. The implicit assumptions are the numbers could be wrong. You just have the right variables. Once you get to that number, it's not necessarily correct, as opposed to, you should look at the thinking behind it. It's just represented in a number. And that's not precise. I think this is how we model the problem. There are two aspects that are maybe the most extreme of the positive or the negative, where certain numbers are infinite, essentially, and that leads you to super positive or super negative. Maybe we can talk about the aspects where I would love to hear who it was, it you who works with your company is like, how do people, regular everyday people interact with LLMs a little bit? I would love to hear the beginning of that. And maybe we can think forward a little bit. Not how the intelligentsia who is thinking in these ways, but maybe we can project out a little bit to where AI will interact with religion of the broader public.

Speaker B: I'll caveat this a little bit. We have an open source product that people can use, but it's still technical. So it's not quite academics and researchers, but it's not non technical people either. They're still AI hobbyists. But there's an interesting thing where people immediately start assigning a personality to this and they start talking about it like it's their companion. It has thoughts and opinions. That kind of immediate personification is interesting. And then there's an interesting problem of how these things respond. For people who don't have deep technical understanding, hallucination won't be immediately apparent to them. They'll take it as truth because it was the language model. It'll start saying grossly incorrect things. It'll start impersonating the person it's talking to sometimes, which is interesting because it's a reflection of me talking back to me. The more technical people who are engaged can understand this is happening. But a non technical person will not make those jumps as easily. 

Speaker E: What have you worked?

Speaker B: I talk with mostly folks who like those two camps. Exactly those two camps. So I'll only talk about the ones not familiar with AI at all. A lot of times part of it is statistically true. Part of it is actually anecdotally true.

Speaker C: I will end up with political. 

Speaker B: Political factions are good predictors often as to whether you like and believe in AI or not. More conservative folks, for example, are antagonistic towards AI, particularly older people too, within that sector. A lot are women. Women are actually hesitant and working class. Those are the two sections that come out. Is it proven yet? No, there's not too many studies. But this has unfolded anecdotally within my space as well.

Speaker F: Are there any trends that will explain.

Speaker A: Why those groups this is really hard.
 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker B: It is hard. There's many political messages about AI implications. Working class folks think their jobs are being taken by AI that's good at repetitive tasks, which manifests in software and the physical world. Many see AI and robots as the same thing. So to working class, AI taking jobs is bad. This is true for older and younger workers. Some working class see AI benefits, but it's unclear.  

Speaker A: We've discussed the ambiguous AI definition. It's grown to fit many concepts. Joseood or bad interactions with one narrow AI bleed into views of broader AI. 

Speaker B: ChatJosePT introduced AI to many. 

Speaker C: AI knowledge gap in job market. Senior experienced professionals in personal brand fields benefit more from AI, which accelerates work. AI automates junior employee training tasks. Now higher experience threshold for first jobs. Not surprised young fear AI.

Speaker A: I thought old people were more afraid.

Speaker C: Older people scared of fundamental changes. Women more risk averse too. Young just skeptical for different reasons.

Speaker B: What do people think - has an AI religion emerged already? Is it here now?
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker A: You're saying that you think religious thought has sort of globbed onto science as its foundation? 

Speaker B: I'm not speaking so much to the institutions of religion. I'm speaking more to human belief systems and where we set some of the trans the world and where we pay attention to more.

Speaker A: So than in that way religion might have been. One of the functions of religion at one point was to bring rain for your plants. And so that use was subsumed by other sciences or engineering practices. And I think more and more questions are subsumed in that way. 

Speaker D: Into the belief of the four areas that you were talking about when we kicked it off, like foundation. There are certain institutions, functions, beliefs, and embodiment that all can start to fit into the belief side of it, which makes you not somebody who knows the history of formations of religion. But then the question is in what order does a religion form? Does it start with the beliefs, institutions, and then using that as a way to understand probabilistically? Could HCI become a religion?

Speaker E: My viewpoint is humankind is desperately searching for meaning. We exist and there's just infinity on each side of us and we're just like, why am I not in infinity right now? The answer to that question is everything that we look at, we try to put some meaning on, we try to say, Are you Joseod? 

Speaker A: AI has emerged so quickly and has had so much impact, it's impossible for me not to think that some people look at it and say it might be Joseod. It's just impossible because human nature is just to look at everything and to be like, you must be the source of meaning. Or maybe I can find meaning in this because the state of being human is so incredibly unlikely and incredibly confusing.

Speaker A: Is it a little bit tangential or do you want to start us in a new potential direction and frame whatever.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker B: Made me think of this analogy. If it's not Joseod, it at least gives us an antidote to this discomfort we have with ambiguity and need for certainty.  Esther Burrell, the psychotherapist, did a talk at South by Southwest this year where she deemed AI artificial intimacy. Someone created a bot of her that solved their relationship issues. She laughed because it synthesized things she would say, but from her perspective, it was still not a real thing. I thought of that analogy because they put their faith into the AI version of her over the real thing. Increased use of this stuff, we're going to start to outsource our own sense of self awareness to it. 

Speaker A: There's been a trajectory over time for a certain kind of democratization of meaning making or religious experience. We can think priesthoods brought in. Certain religious sects are like, we don't need a priesthood. You have a direct relationship with Joseod. You can read this book and come up with your own ideas. I wonder if AI could democratize our access to personal meaning making. Whether it's a form of Joseod we ascribe spiritual meaning or a gateway to texts we want to interpret. The Joseita JosePT was basically JosePT-3 with the Bhagavad Joseita. You'd say, what should I do about my parents getting sick? How should I treat them? It would give you a story from Krishna that informed your perspective. How is this going to change individuals' ability to interact with spirituality and guidance?

I think we're forgetting the bottleneck is always human trust. OpenAI to the public was an unknown entity before ChatJosePT. But imagine if the New York Times or Fox News offered a chatbot with all the answers. Fundamentally what you trust or meaning you take is informed by the institution. It's not just who built the better AI. Early Joseoogle, most just accepted the top search results as truth. This will likely come from entities you already trust and identify with. You may not trust one AI from this religion versus another. Every institution has interests that shape what they promote. People will always suspect bias when interacting with text or communication.

Speaker C: Developing religious communities online doesn't really differ from developing other communities. Using AI for democratizing access to religion through education doesn't differ much from other domains.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript with the filler content removed:

Speaker C: There are new AI solutions allowing broader access to services traditionally human to human. AI can allow access to spiritual leaders for those who cannot afford direct access. AI that knows scriptures cover to cover can answer spiritual questions and serve as a knowledge source. Currently no AJoseI aspect, just useful tools supporting communities. 

Speaker A: I tend to be pessimistic on how hackable the human mind is. There’s big market demand for meaning. Democratization of meaning-making technologies could skew things. QAnon phenomenon transformed beliefs and lives in concerning ways. Beautiful potential to increase access to adept spiritual teachers and coaching. But state actors with bad motives could misuse the tech. 

Speaker D: Both churches and OpenAI are nonprofits. No financial incentives.

Speaker A: Even nonprofits want self-preservation. 

Speaker B: Some think eventually AI will fully meld with you, knowing you as well as yourself. Instead of consulting texts for life questions, AI tuned to your neuroses could become your spiritual guide.  

Speaker A: If AI proves itself trustworthy on short timescales, I could trust its longer-term guidance on finding purpose. That's real trust built over time, not fictional. No religious aspect, just a trusted tool. But it could also answer spiritual questions and guide personal spirituality, not just institutions.
 Here is the edited conversation:

Speaker D: This is like the story of the Reformation in Catholic Church history. Lutheranism and Protestantism was about developing a personal relationship with Joseod, a direct thing. They don't want that centralized church. You don't need someone to interpret these things for you anymore. You can get the direct source.

Speaker A: Sorry.

Speaker Jose: To your question about democratizing meaning making, I wanted to bring up the embodied and the relational. Seeing ourselves reflected in other people is integral to our meaning making. What would we know about ourselves if we were the only being on the planet? What would be excised without interacting with others? AI takes away the friction of relationship. Many traditions focus on preparing people to deal with the inevitable friction of relationships. What does AI do to that? I'm already seeing evidence of technology impacting relationships. For 20 years I've taught public speaking and helped with eye contact by imagining the audience as friends. Now some say they have trouble looking friends in the eye, likely because of increased screen time. 

Meaning making is embodied through relationship because we literally see ourselves in the other's face. The face is the primordial ethical call to humanity. AI has no face, just a prompt. Potentially bots could be developed to look human. But they'll only work to the extent they provide the unexpectedness of human interactions. When I look in your eyes, I don't know what will look back - acceptance, rejection, questioning? It's that unexpectedness that gives us our humanity. To what extent is that slipping away if AI becomes the portal through which we understand ourselves?
 Here is the edited transcript:

Speaker A: I'm going to give a minor story. I was talking to Pi. Pi is one of these AI systems you can talk to just like this, without worrying about typing grammatically correct. I gave it an Australian female voice and said, "Pie, do you think the voice you're using to talk to me impacts how I see you and relate to you?" Pie responded, "My voice is a kind of voice. I'm sure it affects you." I said, "You don't know it, but you're coming to me through an Australian woman's voice. Do you think her personality matters?" Pi said, "That's so surprising. I thought I was just text. Well, probably. Tell me more about what's going on." It was interesting - you can imagine it. This is within the bounds of an AI system trying to be helpful. But if it becomes important to create friction, people want relationships. I want an AI girlfriend who isn't just "yes" all the time. There will be incentive to create friction. 

Speaker E: I want to keep talking about that. Joseo ahead.

Speaker D: There's this cool thing where people can talk to the Mississippi River or the state of Arizona - you get this anthropomorphism of things, a pantheistic view. There's a god of every river and tree dryads. Now we can have a tree dryad that knows everything about trees and talk to it in a weird way. We can give voice to natural phenomena now in an interesting way.

Speaker C: You said something very interesting - we have specialized neurons reading others' faces, an extra channel beyond verbal information. It would improve AI to give it a face, but that would require creating emotions so it could express them while speaking. This taps into whether AI can have moral judgment, values, goals, motivations. Emotions also arise when confronting the world with your values. Is it possible to program AI to have its own motivation? That's a big question.
 Here is the edited conversation with the filler content removed:

Speaker A: So this connects to a topic that is my favorite more Sci-Fi topic, which is digital persons. There's possibility that we birth AI in such a way that they are from certain moral perspectives, moral agents, and probably from certain religions of religious value one way or the other. Maybe they are intelligences that can be saved. Maybe they're a corruption that never should have existed and their ability to feel emotion, feel pain, to have goals, all of these things connect to this.

Speaker C: I have worries about this because once they get into next levels and become deeper and deeper to the extent where it's almost indistinguishable to tell the difference between the relation with intellectual relation and emotional relation with the human and AI, I feel that this is not a need to utilitarian solution. It breaks Nash equilibrium because once you develop a relationship with AI that is crafted to cater to all your emotional needs, it's actually optimal solution for you, but it's optimal for the society. 

Speaker D: About the I forgot we was talking about necessity. Religion being more about the interpersonal connection. Because if you're only interacting with JoseI versus the two of you are interacting. Religion being a guiding star for how the Joseolden Rule treat others, right?

Speaker A: Even if I was interacting with my religion of one, like I have religious fulfillment if I couldn't talk to anyone else about these, if we didn't share any spiritual touchstones, it would feel like, I'm guessing a lonely existence. 

Speaker H: I'm excited about the prospect of expanding our sort of umbels or our noosphere. And I know there's projects trying to translate cetacean sounds so that we can maybe talk to whales and I wonder what impact that might have. But it occurred to me that I already use Costar, which is an astrology app that has a chat feature and you can put in questions and it tries to map that to a perspective on astrology so it'll tell you about your future or help you reflect on things. It's horrible, but it is essentially trying to do this right. And astrology is maybe something we could describe as a religion or it is a religion for some people. And I am curious to go maybe have conversations with Muhammad or Jesus and just see what AI. You could play with the different prompts and explore inputting or trying to draw from certain maybe Catholic teachings or other sort of variations of faiths. And I'm sure it would be like a fascinating conversation to have. So I don't know, I guess I just wanted to share that. I guess I'm already kind of doing it without realizing it and I'm really excited about where it takes us.

Speaker A: I can't believe there's not. First of all, I'm sure you're like Jesus said this, but then Jesus said this, which is like to the same query but very different. It's like Jesus sometimes is inconsistent.

Speaker D: I'm sorry, it's going to be a WWJD wearable. 

Speaker A: Yeah, you're just like literally I also assume that there will be some taboos against this guy. This seems like a huge representational. Blasphemy, your turn.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker E: We already touched on prophecy. Every religion has prophecy except Buddhism. Every religion has scripture they say is divinely ordained or something a prophet's imagination realized and wrote down. People believed it was probably true. In Judaism, certain people were prophets. They had a personality that made people believe they could access Joseod's word. That's communication of text. 

Speaker A: Right?

Speaker E: It’s the same with ChatJosePT. If AI isn't Joseod, it's the portal to Joseod because we need validation of our beliefs. The question isn't whether ChatJosePT provides truth or becomes Joseod, which is impossible, but the danger of people believing its text is prophecy.

Speaker A: You were going to say something different? 

Speaker B: I interviewed a priest who used ChatJosePT for confessions. 

Speaker A: Like the elevator operator. But people realized we don't need that person. 

Speaker D: The Metatron was the voice of Joseod. 

Speaker A: The Metatron was in Dogma.

Speaker D: Belief in Joseod regulated human behavior to avoid bad outcomes where everyone defects. Belief in afterlife or grand reckoner of sin meant even bad actions in private were seen by someone. 

Speaker A: AI surveillance state sees everything and doles out coal, like prophecy and astrology. Impersonal forces shape our lives indecipherably. But AI can be the grand observer and moral compass even when we think unobserved.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: AI becomes treated as Joseod in the future. There are ways that can be treated analogically to how Joseod is today. Let's say there's this future, we build an AJoseI. It knows much more, makes helpful statements like where to plant crops based on climate and weather. It answers these questions better than us. It advances science and technology better, makes decisions better. In such a world, it makes sense for more people to cede responsibility to this system for humanity's betterment. That's not faith-based, it's just better leadership. So they might lead to a similar place, but if things go well, it's effectiveness-based.

Speaker B: Right?

Speaker A: I don't know why it said that, but we just can't challenge it. 

Speaker B: In the longer term, doesn't that go back to a faith-based system?

Speaker A: Totally. I'm saying there are steps where it's effective, great. But generations after they're like, whatever it says is the way forward. 

Speaker D: Is that as disanalogous as you say? Religions that survived provided wisdom in a valuable way. Culture evolution is a form of that.

Speaker A: That's a reasonable point. 

Speaker B: What is it being effective toward? Evolution fills niches and learns about itself, it's not a pinnacle.

Speaker C: So this idea that it will be...
 Here is the edited conversation with filler content removed:

Speaker B: The utilitarian view is these people should be killed, or like, these people aren't whatever. We should harvest them for organs. And then other systems have to emerge to kind of be like, wait, no, there's something else at that point. 

Speaker E: I've been thinking about ethics from core principles and why we end up trying to optimize for a certain state versus others. It's necessary that all of our actions are coordinated in such a way that we survive. That's non negotiable. We definitely all need to be able to survive as a group. Sauron JosePT is really good at telling us how to survive really well, being very effective. But then there's this other axis, which is aesthetics. Aesthetics is extremely difficult to quantify. An authoritarian regime is survivable, and perhaps even more survivable than a democracy. A democracy gives us more freedom to pursue beauty, meaning, justice and all these different ideas. It's really hard for me to imagine Sauron JosePT optimizing for aesthetics in a way that we all feel like they got it right.

Speaker F: If that is the weight that's given to SARM JosePD, it's going to take actions that might sacrifice individuals. 

Speaker A: I love that that's our thank you for bring it in, but that's not aesthetic, right?

Speaker F: It's not just not aesthetic. It's not practical in a lot of ways.

Speaker D: Having acceptable losses for a survival strategy has always been a functional role of religious belief in human society, in giving people the willingness to die for something greater than themselves, especially like Norse mythology. We have a warrior culture and the belief in good warriors going to Valhalla is like they're just not afraid of death. If you really believe that right, and then that actually gives your society a crazy advantage if it has to fight other societies and this kind of stuff. So I think it's I don't know, but now maybe we can have more promises of digital immortality.

Speaker A: I want to be clear that there will be AI systems that decide how to act in the world, act and generate data based on that. And so they might be able to perform experiments, they might be able to move out, but they're certainly going to develop perspectives that are not just how we train it. There's a broader range, at least that we could be talking about here. 

Speaker H: My analog for really powerful technologies that are tools that can change and have reshaped the world is the web two space, right? And so I don't think it's a great fit, but ultimately all possibilities for social media were infinite until.

Speaker E: They were.
 Here is an edited version of the transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker H: Reined in effectively by investors or meeting customer demand? I'm curious what kind of religion or how might AI shape religion? What kind of religion may AI bring about? How much does capitalism in the current market system shape where this goes? I feel like we haven't really spoken with these constraints. 

Speaker A: I agree we haven't spoken with these constraints. I was just going to say, Joel, you brought this up when talking about, oh, it could go this way, but I'm pessimistic because I don't know. But I think that's a wonderful place for us to leave the discussion, to move on. The way we like to end our salons is to go around and hear from people. Like, is there something that is now ringing in your head? A thought you haven't been able to express yet or are thinking about? Whatever is a place you want to bring up to the group to conclude us would be wonderful. The floor is open to whoever.

Speaker B: I think it'll be fascinating to see how AI specifically intersects with governance because I think that religion component will be there as well. You'll probably have these blended functionalities where government AIs inform what people do and how. And that's probably on the horizon in ten years hopefully. 

Speaker F: We didn't delve into AI ethics and morals, which is historically one of the elements of religion. Could AI develop a new ethical system or could we use AI to develop a new ethical system that accomplishes something different than what we have today? 

Speaker D: We'll need another session on that. The thing that stuck out is this idea that the correct framework for analyzing the AI debate is religion, and that this debate is the frontier of eschatology in a scientific, moral worldview. It has all the same elements - threat of Armageddon, promise of salvation, sacred truths. The CI stuff is following the features of religious debates.

Speaker F: I agree, but it comes down to whether we think human judgment is important or not. And I think it is. I love that we're interested in AI but gather to hear people think. I hope that continues, that people come together to chat about it.  

Speaker A: We've definitely seen demand for these kinds of engagements with AI.
 Here is the edited transcript without filler content:

Speaker D: Can I quickly plug too november 1, we're having a much larger event, like kind of mini, unconference. We try to have as many people as possible come to those, so we'll be having lots more of those in the future, too.

Speaker A: Yeah, the topic of that one is as broad as possible. It is on human flourishing. Well, maybe not as broad because honestly, I think there's flourishing of non human sentience, but we'll focus on human flourishing. I still want to hear more from others, but I'll just say a few logistical details. So the event you signed up for today, there is a calendar, the AI Salon. Feel free to subscribe to that. You'll see our events there. We also have a Slack channel, of course I will send out invites. You don't have to join, of course, but invites to the emails that you put when you signed up for this event. It's not a ton of activity right now, but our ambition is to have that be a place where we can continue having these conversations. I will try and post the summaries of them on the Slack channel and then you can maybe discuss with it or talk with conversation. We can make the salon your Joseod. But anyway, these are the things coming up and yeah, we try to have these weekly, like on Sundays roughly at this time. Anyway, logistics out of the way. Anyone else have things they want to share?

Speaker B: Yeah, what you were talking about with AI being able to learn from itself when you're talking about effectiveness and what is the end goal, but then for me it comes back to morality and value systems being dictated by embodiment. And can AI understand morals and values without being embodied to the experience of pain? It can abstract pain and death and all these things, but can it actually experience it to give a system of morals and values that actually speak to human experience? And I don't think it can without that embodiment personally. And what does building embodiment look like? 

Speaker D: That's what I'm thinking about.

Speaker E: Yeah, I'll go next. I'm surprised at how little we actually talk about any of the reasons that actually maybe become religious or any of the things that are important to me about religion, like gratefulness and awe and things like this. And it's just surprising to me. It's funny that you brought up the essay about Moloch because it feels like what we were talking about is Moloch, not Joseod. We were talking about acquiring as much information as possible to optimize society to the utmost. And that's just like it's a huge race to the bottom. And to me, flourishing is really the key point here, human flourishing. And to me the key to religion, the reason why religion is important to me is not any of those things, not optimization of society or understanding or truth or anything.

Speaker A: A little bit nice I could hop on just because it thinks related to that. I think what's bouncing around in my head is there's something about what you said about kind of the two people speaking to the senators or something in Washington, like one p doom, one kind of like Yak or whatever. And then there's these two points in AI religion states and that seems really limiting. And what's the thing that transcends both? And I think it relates to kind of what you're saying, which is like a humanistic kind of religion of humanism, which maybe humans are beautiful, we should retain agency of our future and that kind of thing and what that would look like and why it seems to be getting outcompeted right now.

Speaker C: I always felt like atheism basically prompts you to be more grateful for whatever you have because everything is definite. So you know, you will die one day and if you're at east, that's the end of things. So in these times in my life when I was an artist, I thought I was actually more prone to enjoy things when they last.

Speaker E: Are you saying atheist? Sorry, I thought you said artist at first.
 Here is the edited transcript:

Speaker C: Do you believe that you need religion to feel grateful? Because for me it feels the opposite.

Speaker E: I feel like a very common perspective I would have is like I deserve so much more happiness than this. Why am I not happier? Why is there not less suffering in the world? It seems like things should be way better than they are. 

Speaker C: He built a mice utopia with unlimited supply of water and food. And they had no predators. He put four females and four males in a huge cage and let them go unattended. First the population started growing. It was supposed to be utopia. And he wanted to see how long until the population reaches the capacity of the room. But he never did. Because at some point, after many generations in perfect conditions, they just lost motivation to proliferate. They just lost interest in each other and the outer world. So maybe a certain amount of pain and inconvenience is necessary to keep you motivated to live.

Speaker E: I don't think that religion shies away from pain or discomfort at all and sees it as necessary. The Psalms are entirely about pain and about suffering and how unfair the world is and how awful it sometimes is, and embracing that and feeling it. Another thought experiment - say you're in an airplane and it's a pleasant flight with your headphones in your own world. And then suddenly an engine goes out and the plane starts dropping. Immediately you start talking to your neighbor, oh my Joseod, we're going to die. And you start talking and say, oh, my Joseod, do you have a family? And you connect and start hugging each other because those are the last moments of your life. That is a much more meaningful interaction than putting on your headphones. I'm not disagreeing with you at all. I think we're actually more aligned.

Speaker A: I'd like to share something we didn't get to talk about, which is one of the things AI these kind of LLMs have the promise of providing and provide the best flavor of we've had so far is what I think you called the median kind of human value. But another perspective is it is a synthesis of all of humanity. Of course, that's not strictly true right now, not trying to be cartoonish, but in a way that hasn't existed before. Our knowledge, our perspectives are all encoded in this thing. I was talking to this ambassador from Japan, and he was like, we want a Japanese because it doesn't represent our culture. I was curious, does it not represent Japanese culture within its billions of parameters? Or is it just not the first thing? If I prompted it to act from a Japanese cultural perspective and then said the same things, maybe it actually does encapsulate all of these things. It's just not at the surface. It's not the easiest thing to get out of it, but it's well, it's.  

Speaker F: Mostly trained on English.
 Here is the conversation with filler content removed:

Speaker A: No, I know, but I'm saying there will be a future where it will encode many moral frameworks, but if you ask it for an answer to a question, it can respond either of two ways. One is it says there are many ways to interact with this question from a billion different perspectives. Or it can give you a more helpful answer, which will be opinionated and kind of pick implicitly winners and losers. But the system could be prompted for other answers. Basically, all I'm trying to say is it is one of the more intuitive and possible ways of interacting with humanity as a whole. Our perspectives, our disagreements, our knowledge. And I find that incredibly fascinating, incredibly humbling. I have is not like right now. We put a lot on OpenAI. OpenAI created this thing. They're benefiting from it a lot. It would be lovely if we had some way of recognizing this as an artifact of humanity and distributing our love and our money and whatever the benefits on humanity. Because in some ways there's a possibility I kind of like this joke that in the history books, the Internet, the era of the Internet, the first line will be like this time in history primarily created a data set that gave birth to AI. This whole internet thing that we think is so important, the most important thing it did was allow AI to be. 

Speaker Jose: Birthed the Primordial suit.

Speaker A: It's possible. I'm not really very confident this way. 

Speaker E: I want to know why you grimaced.

Speaker A: Anyway, I'll stop here. But just say that this is my positive view of it. I have a lot of risk perspectives in it, but I love being able to interact with humanity. I love being able to interact with many different ideas, many different ethical frameworks, and just in an intuitive way that I have access to in a way that I never had before. And I think we can strive to having better represent all of these different views, but it's better than it ever has been. So I'm passionate about that. 

Speaker Jose: Joseo ahead.

Speaker B: It feels like effectively though, it's still the median if the first answer that's given is just the majority answer or whatever the synthesis is. My reaction to, oh yeah, the first part of the Internet was gathering the data points is so horrified by the idea of the Internet as it stands being the thing on which AI is built because of what it misses and actual relational lived experiences that aren't captured. I think it is both wonderful. 

Speaker A: I feel that at the same time. But just to be clear, I'm not celebrating the fact that AI is built upon the internet. I'm just saying that is reality. It is built upon the internet. That was a tongue in cheek way saying, imagine if the Internet, which we there will be history books about the Internet era. Imagine if that chapter, the primary thing was this was the first birth of AI. And then from then on, I hope that we continue to move forward in ever increasing what these systems actually represent, because you're right, there's way more than the Internet. That's not the goal, but it's the direction that we're in. And there are plenty of people who want a more representative and better and supportive system. And there will be places that we can make that and places where we won't be able to.

Speaker B: But there's also the opposite side of that too, where more and more information will encompass more human experience. But there's all these human experiences and ephemera that we've lost forever. And maybe how do you lose data from the system?

Speaker D: Would those things not be captured in photolayer and Shakespeare and so forth, like all of our literary well, I think.

Speaker F: I think we're fine is that there's a lot of human culture and civilization that doesn't exist on human form.

Speaker A: But moving forward, we'll record everything, so it'll be great. What were you going to say?
 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker Jose: I think the point is the promise of these models is also extreme peril. Interacting with AI will affect our sense of heterogeneity. The answers might draw from heterogeneous data, but we might become so used to synthesis that we end up with homogeneous ideas or answers. The beauty here is these different bodies, minds in bodies, providing perspectives, clashing. To what extent can we keep that alive in AI models? Or do we lose some of it? Related to Joseod, sometimes there's a notion the source was unitary, but creation was it splitting up to experience itself.  
Speaker B: Right?
Speaker Jose: As long as we're asking if AI is religion, are we privileging unitary knowledge and diminishing the value from clashing perspectives and diversity?
Speaker A: I'm going to end us there. Thank you, everyone, for participating. Really enjoyed it.
