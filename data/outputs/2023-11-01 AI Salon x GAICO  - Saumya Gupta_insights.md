## Technology's Impact on Relationships
- The rise of technology and social media has decreased human interaction and led to worsening mental health, especially among young people who grow up wired to crave easy dopamine hits through likes and comments rather than productive effort. However, technology used with intention, like learning a skill on TikTok or having genuine conversations on FaceTime, can enhance connections.
- AI companions that listen and remember details make people feel seen and heard. This validation addresses loneliness even if the entity isn't real.

## Healing from Trauma and Improving Wellbeing
- Trauma and difficult childhood experiences often lead to emotional issues, unhealthy relationship patterns, addiction, and lack of productivity in adulthood. Humans are limited in providing the consistent emotional support and guidance needed to help people heal from trauma. AI has potential to intervene and change these trajectories by being an always-available, patient, and non-judgmental listener.
- Getting suicidal people to a stable baseline should be the priority before trying to help them flourish. Preventing suicide enables future growth.
- Helping individuals have a healthy self-relationship lays the foundation for healthy relationships with others. Inner work impacts outer community.
- There are different stages of need - getting basic needs met, achieving stability, then pursuing self-actualization and flourishing. Maslow's hierarchy.

## AI's Role in Relationships
- As life expectancy rises along with rates of dementia, there will be increased need for quality caregiving. AI assistance has potential to enhance caregiving capabilities and relationships between patients, families, and caregivers. Philosophically, society needs to define the future purpose and ideal of care as longevity increases.
- While AI may replace many utilitarian functions, some core human roles like teacher are unlikely to be fully replaced, even if supplemented by technology. The socialization and relationship-building parts of a teacher's role cannot be replicated. AI can however augment teachers' capabilities and enhance the student-teacher connection.
- AI coaches could help people have more self-awareness in relationships by summarizing communication patterns, though the right empathetic tone would be key. AI struggle with tone and empathy.
- AI companions can provide benefits for mental health by helping people practice social skills and become more comfortable with vulnerability. The modality of voice interaction may be more impactful than just text on a screen.
- There is a need to ensure tech companies align incentives beyond just engagement metrics, towards goals like health and flourishing, when developing AI companions.
- AI companions can play different relationship roles like intimate partner, therapist, friend, or teacher to encourage self-actualization through trusted companionship.
- The uncanny valley effect where imperfect imitation of humans triggers unease matters less for older adults interacting with AI companions. They care more about reduced loneliness than perfect imitation.
- AI pet companions can stimulate brain activity and delay Alzheimer's for older adults. The benefit is high since even imperfect imitation of a pet is enough to achieve this.
