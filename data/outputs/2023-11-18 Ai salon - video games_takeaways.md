These are the takeaways from the conversation: 2023-11-18 Ai salon - video games.m4a

# Insights
- [Escapism] Games provide escapism and meaning when people feel depressed or question the purpose in their lives. As philosophy notes, even if an asteroid will hit Earth, playing games could still be meaningful by fulfilling basic human needs. As AI changes society, games may become even more critical for meaning and connection.

- [Competitive Drive] The competitive nature of multiplayer games taps into a deeply addictive drive for self-improvement. Hiring a coach to analyze decisions shows how far some go to rank up, satisfying an innate desire to get better.

- [Reactive Worldbuilding] The frontier of gaming is reactive worldbuilding where NPCs respond differently based on player choices, creating more intuitive interactions. This could lead to new tangents and more immersion.

- [Psychological Tricks] Games use psychological tricks to make people have fun. Understanding those tricks from a design perspective reveals the thought behind addictive gaming loops.

- [Gaming Nostalgia] Shared gaming nostalgia across generations shows how influential early game experiences were despite technical limitations at the time. The continued love shapes preferences years later.

- Games have become a major part of youth culture and socialization, which some governments see as potentially harmful. This has led to debate around regulating game time.

- Games are an emerging art form with unique creative potential, almost like a new medium for artistic expression. AI could help realize this potential in new and unexpected ways.

- Competitive game AI seeks to emulate humans to create more realistic challenges, while narrative game AI focuses on generating novelty and creativity in storytelling.

- Interactive fiction and choose-your-own adventure styles could see major innovations from AI that can respond dynamically based on user choices. This presents challenges around keeping things fun.

- Open world games allow for myriad interaction possibilities, but programming believable and context-appropriate NPC responses is extremely complex. AI could help by judging emotional tone and intent behind player actions.

- Completely alien games may be less compelling than worlds with some anchoring rules/frames of reference. AI creativity should balance novelty with grounding.

- Games can leverage AI to dynamically adapt and personalize difficulty levels based on each player's strengths, weaknesses, and preferences. This allows games to keep players challenged but engaged across wider audiences.

- AI directors that dynamically spawn enemies and events based on players' current performance shows promise for keeping co-op multiplayer games intense yet doable. This technology could be expanded to generate new gameplay elements that incentivize use of underutilized abilities.

- Procedural generation of narrative variants based on player choices and stats, as seen in Disco Elysium, creates compelling replayability even in story-driven games. Discussing the differences between playthroughs becomes its own metagame.

- The common ground of shared gameplay mechanics and rulesets, even when playing styles differ, enables more multidimensional social engagement around games than linear media like film. This suggests rich opportunities for AI to study how playstyle reflects personality.

- Over-personalization of information diets into filter bubbles highlights the value of some shared experiences and conversations. Similarly, some randomness or common baseline may be important when adapting games to keep experiences relatable.

- Text-based games powered by AI could create dynamic, non-deterministic gameplay where each playthrough is unique, allowing for more replayability and co-creative storytelling between player and machine. This "generativity" makes them more experiential and immersive.

- AI-powered simulations could let people safely explore alternate life paths and realities they couldn't or wouldn't try in real life. This could reveal insights about decision points and personality.

- Even with highly personalized and unique experiences generated by future AI, common ground and shared understanding could emerge organically through discussing gameplay mechanics, enjoying collectively generated narratives, or bonding over fundamental aspects of human psychology/biology that underpin the simulations.

- AI has shown ability for superhuman storytelling by instantaneously generating detailed worlds, characters, and plotlines in a way humans could not without significant time and effort. This could enable new forms of cooperative, personalized story experiences.

- There is disagreement on whether AI will fully replace human creativity in storytelling, but there is consensus that it can be a powerful tool to enhance and extend human creativity by handling tedious work and enabling new creative directions.

- Different player psychologies desire different levels of open-endedness versus constraints in games and story experiences. AI has potential to adapt across this spectrum, playing an assistant role for some while directly driving more open experiences for others.

- The process of exploring the possibilities of an AI system and uncovering emergent potential can be seen as a form of gameplay itself, akin to experimenting with physics engines. This exploration requires mental effort but can be intrinsically rewarding.

- AI story generation tools could help game developers scale crafting huge open worlds full of detailed interactive characters and quests the way current handcrafted games cannot feasibly support.

- Games provide a simplified version of real life, reducing uncertainty and complexity to create clearer goals and incentives. This parallels how we try to design fair societal systems and interactions. However, real life rarely rewards work proportionately.

- Too much freedom and options in games can overwhelm players and undermine engagement. Constraints fuel creativity. The best games artfully balance direction and agency.

- Games are most compelling when they allow us to deeply inhabit perspectives and experiences beyond our own. They create empathy by replicates internal states. This suggests rich potential for using games to share diverse cultures and lives.

- Games can provide valuable skills like strategic thinking, spatial reasoning, coordination, and flow state engagement that transfers to real world contexts. However, they risk addictiveness and escapism when used excessively. Moderation and self-awareness are key.

- The social connections and sense of achievement from multiplayer games can become addictively appealing replacements for real-world relationships and accomplishments. But they also hint at universal psychological needs that could perhaps be better met through real-world community.

- As virtual worlds approach realism, they raise philosophical questions about what constitutes a "real" life experience and a "good" life. Games already reflect the gamification of modern society. At what point do certain games become preferable environments to live in?

- Games allow us to create and explore new realities unlike anything possible in real life. At their best, they expand human experience. At their worst, they are exploited by corporations to hook in players. Their value depends on how we choose to use them.

- Games helped some conference participants build skills, make friends, and even become game developers. But one participant's roommate developed a destructive addiction. The same medium that benefited some ruined others. Its impact depends on the individual.

- Games can provide incredibly detailed simulations that allow players to gain real-world skills applicable to complex jobs like piloting airplanes or performing surgery. The level of immersion and practice in a safe environment accelerates skill acquisition.

- Games intrinsically provide a sense of progression, control, and confidence that can be addictive, especially for those lacking these feelings in real life. Addictiveness stems from both the psychological rewards and the captivating stories/worlds.

- Stigmas around gaming as a waste of time are fading as games become recognized as valuable learning tools and pro gamers demonstrate elite skillsets. Games are being used for practical applications like recruitment and job training.

- Easy game development tools will enable more people to create simulations and models that teach real concepts. Games can simplify complex ideas like orbital mechanics in ways lectures cannot.

- The military uses games for both recruitment propaganda and remote piloting of drones/vehicles. Game controllers are even designed for compatibility with real military vehicles.

- The ability to simulate complex scenarios like surgery or driving can enable more effective training, but also raises questions around automation and agency. At what point does a perfect simulation remove the need for human involvement?

- There are limitations around fully simulating all possibilities for complex real-world situations like surgery. AI could help explore more potential complications but some randomness will likely remain.

- Living a pre-determined "optimal" life guided entirely by an AI removes agency and the meaning that comes from making one's own choices, even if the end result looks the same on paper. The experience of deciding matters.

- Invisible influence from algorithms that nudges people towards more positive outcomes could be an interesting middle ground between full automation/loss of agency and no guidance. Though transparency and consent would need to be considered carefully.

- The debate around free will and agency in a deterministic universe underlies several points raised. Is the feeling of making choices important even if that illusion of agency doesn't really exist metaphysically?

I aimed to extract some thought-provoking perspectives from the conversation without taking a firm stance on any single position. Please let me know if you would like me to modify or expand the insights in any way.

- Games can help develop moral character by putting players in simulated situations with moral dilemmas, allowing them to build "muscles" for making ethical decisions through practice. Just as some games now test strategic thinking, games could test and develop moral faculties.

- Immersivity comes not just from game mechanics, but from the player's headspace. To accurately assess someone's decision-making, a game needs emotional investment, not just technical gameplay.

- Games excel at testing specialized skills like flying planes, but fail at simulating complex human interactions. Truly understanding a person may require games that capture nuanced dialogue and relationships.

- Personality in games can be context-dependent - people may act differently across genres and objectives. Using games to evaluate someone's character should consider a diverse range of situations, not just one game.

- Societal influences shape behavior in games, similar to real life. Understanding individual agency versus social norms could provide insight into a player's worldview and values.

- Game developers are hesitant to incorporate AI like chatGPT into games due to potential issues with consistency of personality and tone across stories. Maintaining a diversity of narratives and voices is seen as important.

- There is a concern that overreliance on AI for game dialogue could make games feel repetitive and formulaic over time if the same models are widely adopted. More human creativity and authorship may still be needed.

- Independent, smaller scale games may be more willing to experiment with AI for unique experiences than big AAA studios who have established pipelines. This could lead to more innovation coming from indie developers.

- Games focused on emergent narrative like Rimworld demonstrate the engaging potential of AI-assisted story generation paired with strategic gameplay and rich decision making. Hybrid human/AI approaches could capture the benefits of both.

- Concepts of free will, determinism, human betterment and the expanding capabilities of AI systems provoke profound philosophical discussions on the human condition that game narratives could further explore.

- The potential for highly immersive video game worlds to be addictive and have negative societal impacts, with historical precedents like China limiting game time.

- The cyclical relationship between science fiction inspiring new technologies, which then enable new visions of the future in sci-fi.

- Using video games as imaginative spaces to "war game" possible futures and build resilience.

While interesting discussions, I did not find any highly creative or unexpected insights in the conversation. Let me know if you would like me to try generating speculative insights based on extending the concepts brought up.

# Disagreements
- One disagreement was around whether AI should aim to fully simulate human behavior and emotions in video games, or only incorporate select elements that enhance fun and entertainment. Some argued that fully mimicking human reactions could create more immersive experiences, while others contended too much realism may reduce enjoyment and that AI should focus on judiciously blending reality and fantasy.

- Another disagreement was whether AI has more potential to transform competitive/multiplayer games by making computer-controlled opponents more human-like, or story-based/single-player games by expanding creativity and narrative possibilities. Some discussed AI improving multiplayer dynamics like personalized grudges or mistakes, while others highlighted AI's ability to generate new plot directions and worlds in solo adventures.

- [Disagreement 1] One speaker argues that increased personalization of media experiences could lead to people feeling isolated in their own worlds, while another speaker counters that there will still be shared mechanics and fundamentals that provide common ground for people to relate to each other's experiences.

- [Disagreement 2] One speaker envisions highly customized AI-generated games tailored specifically to each person in the future, arguing this could be socially isolating. Another speaker disagrees, arguing that the constraints and systems used to generate such experiences would still allow for commonalities between people's experiences that make sharing meaningful.

- One speaker believes AI tools will never be better than human dungeon masters at creating immersive roleplaying game experiences, while another speaker believes AI tools have recently shown superhuman storytelling abilities that could surpass humans.

- One speaker sees using AI tools in open-ended games as requiring unpleasant mental work to process uncertainty, while another speaker sees it as a creative challenge similar to puzzles in games like Breath of the Wild.

- One speaker felt that giving players too much freedom and options in games can lead to worse experiences, wasted time, and losing the incentive to progress. Other speakers disagreed, arguing that more player creativity, freedom and ownership over the experience is missing from current games.

- One speaker preferred engaging with the predefined vision and art of a game designer. Another speaker valued the potential for games to allow players to have personalized experiences that foster empathy by "living another life".

- [Disagreement 1] Whether video games can be educational and develop useful skills, or if they are mostly a waste of time and promote escapism. Some argued games help develop spatial reasoning, strategic thinking, coordination, etc. Others felt games don't teach truly useful skills and can be addictive escapes from reality.

- [Disagreement 2] Whether the potential for highly immersive/addictive video games and virtual worlds is a net positive or negative. Some felt it enables the creation of richer alternate worlds and experiences. Others worried it further promotes escapism and detracts people from engaging with the real world.

- One disagreement is around whether having an AI assistant decide every aspect of your life in order to optimize outcomes would still allow for human agency and meaning. Some argue that even if the outcomes are the same, the experience of choosing for oneself is an important part of meaning and fulfillment. Others question how much human agency actually exists and whether optimizing for outcomes is more important.

- Another disagreement is around whether AI should invisibly prompt people towards more positive decisions and outcomes versus leaving decisions fully to human agency. One side argues that invisible AI influence could improve people's lives while preserving a sense of control and agency. The other side argues that any kind of "puppet master" controlling things, even invisibly, goes against the innate human need for autonomy.

- One disagreement was around whether games can actually present realistic moral dilemmas that people face in real life. Some argued that games often fail to have truly complex moral choices, while others gave examples of games that do confront players with tough moral tradeoffs.

- Another disagreement was over whether playing games reveals much about a person's actual personality and moral character, or if people act very differently in games than they would in real life situations. Some argued games could be insightful, while others said people play roles in games that don't necessarily reflect their true selves.
