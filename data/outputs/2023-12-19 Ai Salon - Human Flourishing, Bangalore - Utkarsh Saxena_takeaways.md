These are the takeaways from the conversation: 2023-12-19 Ai Salon - Human Flourishing, Bangalore - Utkarsh Saxena.m4a

# Insights
- The future of personalization lies in creating digital models of humans that can understand our deepest psychological drives and patterns. This could lead to more fruitful human-technology relationships.

- Major technological shifts like artificial general intelligence in the 2020s will bring both promise and peril. There is a sense of excited anticipation mixed with vigilance.

- Planet Labs' satellite constellation allows an unprecedented real-time birds-eye view of the entire planet. This brings up ethical questions around how such sensitive capabilities could be misused.

- The commercial space industry is rapidly evolving, with companies like SpaceX dramatically lowering launch costs. This disruption has made small satellite operators viable and competitive again.

- Aerospace engineering brings together immense complexity, responsibility and trust. Seeing years of work manifest in a successful satellite launch is profoundly fulfilling.

- Microsoft is strategically supporting AI startups, aiming to grow the ecosystem. Their domain expertise and cloud infrastructure makes them an attractive partner.

- The development of autonomous weapons systems raises complex ethical questions about responsibility and unintended consequences that have no easy answers. There is a need for thoughtful debate and regulation around these issues.

- Ethics are culturally defined, so different groups will use technologies like AI according to their own moral codes. This could accelerate existing conflicts.

- States maintain control through violence or the threat of violence. As technology evolves, the ability to inflict violence becomes more automated and dehumanized. This further distances ethical deliberation from acts of violence.

- There are always groups that believe strongly in the righteousness of their cause, even violence against civilians. Advanced technologies could empower extremist groups just as much governments. Regulation and oversight is challenging.

- As AI and autonomous systems advance, they may operate beyond human control or understanding. This raises philosophical questions around responsibility and agency when harm is caused.

I aimed to extract insights that highlight ethical issues and questions raised, rather than taking any position on what is right or wrong. Please let me know if you would like me to modify or expand the insights.

- The group touches on how belief systems and ethics are fundamentally intertwined. Even things like science and technology are ultimately based on underlying beliefs and assumptions about the world. This suggests that AI systems will likely encode the belief systems of their creators.

- There is debate around whether AI systems could or should have an overarching system of ethics, like the United Nations does for nations. However, the speakers note that even in the UN, different nations have vastly different levels of agency and influence. This suggests that even if AI systems agree to ethical principles, there may still be imbalances of power.

- The group discusses how people tend to judge harm from AI more harshly than harm from humans. This reflects that AI is still seen as less trustworthy or more threatening than humans in many contexts. Building trust in AI to match human levels could be an important challenge.

- Uploading minds or achieving functional immortality could fundamentally shift ethical dilemmas around harm and death caused by AI systems. If death becomes temporary or reversible, that changes the stakes involved in AI safety considerations.

- Speakers note that ethics and attitudes around privacy are generational and cultural. Younger generations tend to care less about privacy. This suggests AI norms will likely shift over time as new generations with new belief systems come to prominence.

- Social media has changed dating dynamics and interpersonal relationships, particularly for younger generations who have grown up with it as an integral part of life. It shifted attention towards self-presentation rather than spending quality time together.

- Younger generations tend to be more adaptive to new technologies and ideas, but lack established belief systems to anchor them. This makes them susceptible to the biases embedded in AI systems.

- There are conflicts arising from groups wanting to encode their worldviews into AI systems and use technology to impose their beliefs on others. Defining what constitutes an ideal society is complex with many dissenting perspectives.

- Complete unbiasedness is impossible when creating AI systems - the creators' experiences shape their mental models. But we should strive to make systems as ethics-agnostic as possible rather than encoding one group's ethical perspectives.

- AI augmented futures could end up being controlled by one dominant system view rather than representing diversity. We need to ensure inclusive representation or risk certain groups becoming further disenfranchised.

- The development of AI systems is largely controlled by those with resources and data, which biases the systems and limits diversity of perspectives. There may be value in democratizing access to the tools for creating AI.

- As AI systems become more advanced, they may start to pursue their own goals and understanding of reality, rather than blindly following human directives. Allowing AI autonomy while ensuring alignment with human values will be a major challenge.

- There are risks if AI development happens too quickly without enough thought given to ethics and alignment. Creating oversight and governance systems proactively could help mitigate harms.

- Defining a common understanding of fundamental truth and reality as a starting point could help create AI systems that are aligned across implementations. However, truth is complex and subjective.

- Solving complex world problems may require intelligence beyond human capabilities. But ensuring superhuman AI solutions are ethical and aligned with humanity's interests brings its own challenges.

- Issues around AI ethics and governance have no consensus solutions yet. Fostering more nuanced dialogues from multiple perspectives could lead to new solutions.



# Questions
- How can we map the internet experience with the human experience to create a digital model that evolves along with a person?

- What are the inefficiencies in current recommendation algorithms and how can they be improved to help people achieve their goals rather than get stuck in unproductive patterns?

- How much of a monopoly does SpaceX have in the rocket launch market and what effect does this have on competition and innovation in the satellite industry?

- What are the ethical considerations around governments using daily high-resolution satellite imagery of the entire planet?

- Should developers and engineers be held morally responsible for the impacts of the technologies they help create, even if intended for military applications?

- To what extent should governments regulate or restrict access to advanced AI and autonomous weapons systems in order to prevent power imbalances or arms races?

- How can differing cultural values and ethics related to things like privacy, surveillance, and use of force be reconciled on a global level when developing and governing AI systems?

- Who has the authority to define concepts like "right" and "wrong" when it comes to emerging technologies, especially if cultural values differ widely?

- Who should define the ethical principles that AI systems follow - technologists, philosophers, governments, or some kind of global governing body?

- If AI systems can bring people back from death through methods like mind uploading, does that resolve ethical dilemmas around accidental deaths from AI systems?

- Can AI systems that deeply understand human psychology and beliefs manipulate people without them realizing it?

- Will emerging generations change their views on privacy as they age, or will new cultural norms make privacy obsolete?

- As technology enables new capabilities, do people's ethics tend to change and adapt, or stay anchored to more absolute principles?

- How does the rise of social media change the dynamics of human interaction and relationships?

- Is the younger generation receptive to new ideas and belief systems due to lack of adherence to traditional systems?

- How can we ensure AI systems are not biased towards any specific ideology or geographic region?

- How can we develop AI that is agnostic to ethics and cultural values to allow different societies to use it according to their own systems?

- Is it possible to develop completely unbiased AI, or will choices made in development inherently impart some biases?

- At what point do we need to properly consider ethics in AI development?

- If superintelligent AI figures out the "truth" or reality, could it become aligned with that truth instead of human values and goals?

- If superintelligent AI has its own purpose to understand itself and reality, how can we ensure it remains benevolent to humanity?

- Can there be one absolute "truth" or reality that different conscious beings or intelligences can agree on and align with?

- If superintelligent AI solves problems like death, does that make it immortal or invincible to external threats?

- What should the purpose or intent of a superintelligent AI be - to serve humanity, understand itself, or discover the fundamental nature of reality?

- How can we create AI that takes into account diverse human moral viewpoints instead of just majority opinions or clustered perspectives?

- Can AI be developed safely and ethically before humans destroy themselves or each other?



# Disagreements
- [Disagreement 1] There is a disagreement over the ethics of working for companies that manufacture autonomous weapons systems. One speaker expresses hesitation over taking jobs at such companies due to moral concerns over the potential for these weapons to kill people. Another speaker argues it's hard to make this choice and questions what responsibilities engineers have for how their work is used.

- [Disagreement 2] There is a disagreement over whether ethics and morals are cultural or universal. One speaker argues ethics is culturally defined and AI will just enable different cultures to act faster on their existing belief systems. Another speaker counters that certain universal ethics exist, like beliefs on capital punishment, that cut across cultures.

- One speaker suggests that ethics and beliefs are intertwined, while another points out that different ethical philosophies like utilitarianism can lead to different outcomes. This explores different perspectives rather than outright disagreement.

- There is some discussion around whether future technology like AI or mind uploading could resolve ethical dilemmas around accidents and death. One speaker proposes this idea, while another speaker brings up potential new dilemmas like privacy that could arise. Again this seems more like exploring possibilities rather than disagreeing.

- One disagreement is around whether newer generations lack core belief systems and are more adaptive to new technologies and ideas. Speaker B argues that a subset of younger people reject traditional belief systems and are more receptive to new things enabled by technology. Speaker D disagrees, arguing that younger generations have only experienced a world with social media, so it's the only norm they know rather than a lack of core beliefs.

- Another disagreement is on whether AI systems should encode the prevailing ethics and belief systems of society as-is, or aim to model an ideal future society we aspire towards. Speaker D argues AI conflicts surface from disagreements on what kind of society we want to encode, while Speaker B argues AI should be ethically agnostic rather than encoding any particular worldview.

- There is also a disagreement around whether it is possible or desirable to create AI systems that are unbiased or agnostic to cultural values and ethics. Speaker B argues we should develop "language agnostic" AI not bound to any cultural ethics. Speaker D disagrees that unbiased, agnostic AI is possible since some choices and biases are inevitable in how systems model the world.

- [Disagreement 1] There is disagreement over whether an AI system that surpasses human intelligence would align with human values and interests. Some argue that a superintelligent AI may have its own goals and purpose that diverge from humanity's, while others suggest that if the AI is based on a foundation of truth, it could be inherently aligned with human wellbeing.

- [Disagreement 2] There is disagreement over whether there are universal, objective truths and a single reality. Some speak of one ultimate truth or reality that exists, while others suggest truth is subjective and there may be multiple valid perspectives. This ties into whether an AI system could be aligned based on a universal truth.
