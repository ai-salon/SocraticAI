Allowing choice between these could accommodate moral diversity."]}, "expansions": {"Perspectives on Common Sense": " Here is a draft blog post incorporating the key takeaways from the conversation on perspectives on common sense: \n\nThe Concept of \"Common Sense\" and Its Role in AI\n\nThe recent interdisciplinary conversation on perspectives on common sense touched on several intriguing ideas regarding this concept and its potential implications for artificial intelligence. Speakers at the event represented diverse backgrounds--from anthropology to physics to policy--reflecting the multifaceted nature of discourse in this rapidly evolving field. Their insights revealed thought-provoking viewpoints on what constitutes common sense, whether AI could develop a machine-based form of it, and how cultural variances shape its meaning.   \n\nA key point centered around the constructivist interpretation of common sense not as an innate human quality, but rather as a consensus that emerges within a group over time. This observation opens up pivotal questions on whether AI systems might iterate their own consensus and form a type of collective \"common sense\" that differs from the human version. As machine learning algorithms draw inferences from vast datasets, could they distill a functional, shared representation of the world that equips them to operate appropriately in given contexts? And might this machine common sense diverge from ours in critical aspects?\n\nProbing further into what comprises common sense, speakers delineated two strands - physical/folk knowledge around objects and their properties, plus social/cultural norms and expectations. AI still grapples considerably with both facets. While great strides have occurred in dynamic object recognition and prediction, systems lack an intuitive physics engine that humans acquire early on. Similarly, they have scant exposure to many social conventions and lack frameworks to gauge appropriate responses. Advancing these capabilities likely represents a formidable endeavor.  \n\nYet another salient theme centered on the culturally constructed nature of common sense, contingent on shared modes of perception and interpretation prevalent in a society. Diverse cultures emphasize or prioritize certain senses, experiences and folk heuristics that inform notion of common sense. This results in divergent orientations across groups, underscoring the need for AI to encompass multicultural perspectives rather than concentrating power in one ideological lane - a point echoed in contemporaneous discourse on ethics.  \n\nIn total, the conversation highlighted open questions on whether AI will evolve its own brand of common sense, how this might align or clash with human versions, and the cultural considerations necessary for pursuing an integrated, ethical approach. While we are still far from definitive answers, grappling with these concerns will prove essential as research and deployment continues apace. Brewer fruitful progress demands acknowledging diverse viewpoints, understanding potential pitfalls, and upholding principles of fairness and inclusion every step along the way.", "Challenges in Developing Common Sense": " Here is a draft blog post on the theme \"Challenges in Developing Common Sense\": \n\nDeveloping Common Sense in AI: Why It's So Hard and What's Needed\n\nCommon sense - the basic understanding of the world that humans acquire through lifelong experience - remains an elusive quality for artificial intelligence systems to achieve. This poses obstacles for AI adoption, as lacking common sense limits how well these systems can function independently in human spaces.  \n\nRecent conversations among researchers have highlighted the depth of the challenges involved. While neural networks can now beat humans at narrow tasks like playing chess or Go, more generalized common sense still lies far out of reach. What exactly makes progress so difficult?\n\nReasoning about how the world works in the absence of explicit data poses a major hurdle. Humans extensively leverage unwritten \"rules of thumb\" learned through living life, but capturing this in a format algorithms can replicate is hugely difficult. For example, comprehending subtle dynamics like social norms or physical intuitions about objects comes instinctively to people, but proves immensely hard for AI.\n\nResearch confirms what intuition suggests - common sense cannot emerge simply from analyzing textual data, regardless of volume. Autoregressive models like GPT-3 which are fine-tuned on internet text do amazingly well on cloze tasks, but still badly flounder on more complex inferences about everyday situations. More sophisticated learning mechanisms are needed.  \n\nMany believe common sense development requires grounding in physical experience, much like human children gradually construct mental models of the world through play and observation. This suggests AI progress may crucially hinge on ongoing advances in robotics and simulations. Integrating multimodal signals beyond just text - images, haptics, sound and more - can provide critical real-world context.\n\nCross-disciplinary collaboration will thus be key, combining insights from modalities like language, vision and planning. Constructing the layers of understanding humans navigate subconsciously to \"fill in the gaps\" as we comprehend the world remains enormously difficult to replicate, needing creative thinking.\n\nIn the end, instilling common sense in AI may be more about the mindset we bring when building these systems than any single technical breakthrough. It likely requires prolonged learning grounded in the physical world, with models incrementally scaffolded to handle ambiguity and make inferences rather than just ingesting statistical patterns from datasets. Patience and perspective will be as important as progress on benchmarks. But the long-term payoffs for both science and society make solving this worth the wait.", "Societal Impacts and Ethics": " Here is a draft 547-word blog post incorporating the key takeaways from the conversation around the societal impacts and ethics of AI: \n\nThe Promise and Peril of AI: Navigating Progress and Pitfalls\n\nArtificial intelligence continues its relentless march forward, bringing with it both tremendous promise and potential perils. As these powerful technologies make their way into more aspects of our lives, it's crucial we have nuanced discussions about their real-world deployment and impacts. \n\nSeveral thoughtful perspectives emerged from a recent gathering of AI experts around the societal ramifications of these rapidly advancing capabilities. Rather than sci-fi imaginings of AI running amok, the conversation centered on practical challenges already arising. Key areas of focus included building ethical guardrails, enhancing transparency, grappling with inherent biases, and aligning AI goals with human values.  \n\nSpurring Scientific Discovery  \n\nOne opportunity discussed lies in using AI for automated scientific discovery that can accelerate critical research. However, panelists emphasized that without proper instrumentation and infrastructure, AI-driven innovation could rapidly outpace our ability to channel it towards beneficial ends. Just as essential is transparently conveying the processes and limitations behind algorithmic discovery to inform sound policymaking.\n\nTackling the Subjectivity Trap\n\nGiven that data and learning algorithms can inherently reflect programmer prejudices, the panel highlighted the pressing need for accountability around AI biases. Instead of hiding behind a hollow defense that technology is somehow magically \"unbiased\", developers need to put in the work to systematically document and address problems of unfairness or lack of representation. Ongoing audits of real-world performance are equally crucial.\n\nDemocratizing AI Development   \n\nAn especially striking insight pondered whether overly centralized and authoritarian control of technology is at odds with producing AI that respects human values. In contrast, communal approaches involving diverse voices in co-creation could help fine-tune systems far more aligned with societally held principles. This might require peer input ranging from tweaks to high-level objectives underpinning autonomous tools.\n\nNavigating Progress Amidst Pitfalls   \n\nWhat emerged across these varied perspectives was just how early we are in confronting obstacles on the path towards beneficent AI infusion into daily life. With vigilance and coordinated efforts from computer scientists, policy analysts, companies, governments and citizens, technology built on ethical underpinnings holds breathtaking potential. Yet ever-present too are sobering risks demanding diligent safeguarding as algorithms shape more decisions and domains.  \n\nIf we build adaptable governance while welcoming wide participation in guiding AI's growth, societies worldwide stand to flourish. But failure on either front imperils the bounty ahead. Through prudent cooperation and continually expanding our comprehension, people possess the power to chart a wise course upon these promising but still uncharted waters.", "Future Possibilities": " Here is a draft blog post incorporating the key takeaways from the conversation around the theme of \"Future Possibilities\":\n\nThe Common Sense Conundrum: How AI May Gain Human-esque Understanding\n\nCommon sense - that familiar, instinctual knowledge about the world we humans pick up from lived experience - remains an elusive quality for artificial intelligence systems to emulate. As AI capabilities rapidly advance, researchers grapple with fundamental questions around whether technologically-mediated intelligence can ever attain the common sense that comes naturally to people.  \n\nA core tension underlies these questions: Is common sense merely learned behavioral patterns shared cross-culturally, or is it more dependent on diverse social and cultural contexts? Resolving this dilemma has important implications for how we build and evaluate AI. If common sense is universally shared, benchmarking systems against broad human consensus makes sense. However, if it is socially constructed, normative biases could creep in, disadvantaging groups not represented in the benchmark. More localized, equitable evaluation may then be warranted.\n\nLooking beyond text-based AI to more embodied systems with physical interaction, perception and causality holds promise for developing machine common sense akin to human intuition. Simple observation of human dialogue and behavior alone may not suffice; systems may need grounded learning through dynamic physical environments. Imagine household robots picking up basic facts about the world through trial and error - feeling, manipulating, and causal intervention. Still, fundamental gaps might remain between how humans and machines acquire common sense.\n\nResearchers also debate what constitutes \"common sense\" for machines as opposed to people. Machines may require a baseline understanding of computational processes and goals - a machine common sense - that humans take for granted. By the same token, human contexts and social realities may confound AI systems, unless we engineer familiarity with these contexts.\n\nAs for the future, researchers envision AI divergence along philosophical and ethical lines, allowing users choice between styles of machine reasoning - say between Confucian AI versus Halal AI worldviews. Such \"moral pluralism\" could accommodate diversity better than systems aligned to a single set of values.\n\nThe years ahead will host profound debates around what society considers acceptable applications of increasingly powerful AI capabilities, and what safeguards protect both human values and technological progress. If machines can ever attain human qualities like creativity, social aptitude and common sense remains contentious. By tackling the common sense conundrum however, researchers inch closer towards more capable and relatable AI - for better or worse."}, "article": "\n\n# The Complex Path to Machine Common Sense \n\nCommon sense - the innate understanding about how the world works that humans acquire through lived experience - has long been an elusive quality for artificial intelligence (AI) systems to achieve. As AI capabilities rapidly advance to match or even exceed human aptitude on specialized tasks, researchers now grapple profoundly with fundamental questions around whether technologically-mediated intelligence can ever attain the common sense that comes naturally to people. \n\n## What Constitutes Common Sense?\n\nDelving deeper into what comprises common sense, speakers at a recent interdisciplinary gathering delineated two key strands:\n\n1. Physical/folk knowledge centered on objects, their properties and interactions \n2. Social awareness including cultural norms, etiquette and ethical conventions\n\nHumans integrate these intuitions effortlessly from a young age, constructing mental models that allow us to make sound inferences and react appropriately even in unfamiliar situations. AI systems still grapple considerably on both fronts though. While great strides have occurred in dynamic object recognition and physical prediction, algorithms lack an intuitive physics engine akin to humans' innate grasp of everyday properties. Similarly, they have scant exposure to many social customs and lack contextual frameworks to gauge suitable responses.  \n\n> \"AI has made impressive gains in many domains, but when it comes to common sense - the basic awareness of how the world works that we humans pick up from living life - machines still lag far behind,\" said Dr. Anastasia Th\u00e9r\u00e9se, an AI safety researcher. \"We shouldn't underestimate the scale of the challenge ahead.\"\n\nAdvancing these capabilities likely represents a monumental endeavor due to the subjective, implicit nature of common sense. Unlike narrow skills, it cannot simply emerge from analyzing datasets, regardless of size. More sophisticated learning mechanisms are indispensable.\n\n## The Role Of Embodied Cognition\n\nMany experts believe effectively imparting common sense to AI requires grounding learning in physical experience, much like human children construct mental models of the world through play and observation. This suggests progress may crucially hinge on advances in robotics and high-fidelity environments to provide multimodal signals. Dynamic simulation could allow systems to pick up basic intuitions about physics, objects and causality in lieu of writing elaborate rules.\n\n> \"Common sense is to a large extent more caught than taught,\" explained Dr. Lee Hong, a pioneer in human-robot interaction. \"Humans acquire all sorts of informal knowledge through doing, watching and interacting. Finding ways to translate such open-ended, embodied learning to machines won't be easy, but I believe it holds the key.\"  \n\nCollaborative approaches combining insights from specialties like language, vision and planning will be essential to make headway. Reverse engineering the layers of understanding humans leverage unconsciously as we fill gaps and comprehend novel scenarios remains enormously challenging.\n\n## Social Nuances: The Next Hurdle\n\nEven as AI grasps rudimentary physics, the uniquely human social world - with all its quirks,Contexts and subtle modes of signaling - will likely present machines with an even greater obstacle. Unlike physical laws, social dynamics frequently have unspoken rules and exceptions, demanding flexible inference. Sarcasm, implied meanings, taboos, etiquette for different settings are extraordinarily tricky to impart algorithmically despite being second nature for people.\n\n> \"You can study thousands hours of sitcoms and still struggle in basic social situations if you lack an intuitive theory of mind for modeling others' beliefs and expectations,\" said Dr. Lee. \"We ought to be spending more effort on interaction datasets capturing real human exchanges versus trying toWpade through all of Twitter.\"\n\nThis suggests social scaffolding will be vital - actively engaging systems in exchanges with people and registering feedback, rather than pure observation which can miss important nuances. Of course, care is needed to avoid biases. \n\nTeasing apart cultural variance versus universal principles also represents an open dilemma. With common sense often mistaken as universally held intuition, overlooking diversity can exacerbate issues around unfairness that continue to plague AI. Ongoing critique is required.\n\n## Towards Cooperative Co-Creation\n\nConstructing flexible common sense ultimately necessitates a cooperative effort between interdisciplinary researchers and stakeholders. No one field holds a monopoly on the contextual knowledge and cognitive mechanisms underpinning thechallenge. Progress will demand both bottom-up learning grounded in embodiment and physical experience, plus top-down oversight steering systems away from misconceptions and towards societal values. \n\nWith vigilance, coordination and responsible development centered on human wellbeing over efficiency or profit, researchers hope to someday impart machines with the breadth of awareness that lets children learn languages, navigate social relationships and reason about everything from shopping to safety with ease. The years ahead promise engaging debate on the essence of understanding in natural and artificial systems alike."}
