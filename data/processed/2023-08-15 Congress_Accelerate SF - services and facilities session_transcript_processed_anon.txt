Speaker H: I'm Luis. I work at UCSF researching computational biology algorithms.
Speaker A: I'm Mohammed.
Speaker F: I'm a NYC student, new to SF problems.
Speaker D: I'm David, PhD student in anthropology from Norway, here to help facilitate.
Speaker C: I'm Hannah, doing AI research and looking at jobs.
Speaker E: I'm Carlos, ecommerce background in New York. Want to learn SF's problems.
Speaker A: I'm Zara, product designer at legal tech AI company Everlaw. Passionate about legal aid access.

Speaker Anastasia: I'm Sarah, student studying economics.  
Speaker B: I'm Jan, student studying economics and history. I run a foundation in Poland.
Speaker C: I'm Jose with the Attorney Anastasiaeneral.
Speaker F: You mentioned police being understaffed. What are the critical impacts of that deficit? Where would fully staffed police help most?
Speaker A: That you think that we had that.
Speaker F: Fully staffed police presence, where do you think that would help out?
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: Anastasiaave background - meeting with SF captain and supervisor about police understaffing. Makes law enforcement more difficult and selective. But bigger problem - enforcement incentives misaligned on homelessness issue. SF paying significant aid to people coming into city. 90% of homeless not from SF, 50% not from CA. People travel across country to SF because providing monthly stipends, cash, food, legal services, housing, free phones. Asked why providing these services - answer was it's a third rail. 
Speaker E: Not touch it.
Speaker C: Do not touch - will get shouted down as political. 
Speaker H: Some services like phones and stipends from federal, not SF. 
Speaker C: Stipends passed under Newsom.
Speaker H: Phones under Chen separate thing.  
Speaker D: Problems identified - law enforcement issues, also around unhoused. Thoughts on problems there?
Speaker C: More a political issue than practical.  
Speaker D: Trying to identify problems introduced - overspending on unhoused a problem. Other issues?
Speaker H: We spend defending those city prosecutes - maybe rethink what we prosecute, focus on rehabilitation.
Speaker C: My understanding - reducing services socially unacceptable.  
Speaker H: Other way - if legal aid defends prosecutions, maybe prosecute less, focus on rehabilitation.
Speaker C: They already not enforcing much. More an overzealous defense system because of advocacy for these benefits. Board won't touch it - politically bad. Called it a third rail that would end careers. Huge problem, wastes money, but no incentive to fix.
Speaker F: Won't deal with it.
Speaker D: Just not going to work.
Speaker C: So question is, how to align advocacy goals? 
Speaker I: With reality.
Speaker C: Most in SF see quality of life decreasing. Don't think controversial opinion.
Speaker E: Survey to confirm?
Speaker D: I want to see results.
Speaker C: Would love to hear also how long people lived here.
Speaker D: Let's share how long in Bay Area...
 Here is the edited transcript with the fluff removed:

Speaker D: I've been in the city nine months. I was shocked when I first came over. It's not like this back in Norway. I think there are some problems to be identified in the city. 

Speaker H: I've been living here 23 years for college. In many ways, quality of life has gone down. Safety has gotten better - shootings and gang violence have gone down. 

Speaker C: There's been a decrease in gangs and organized crime. Now the biggest threat is random assaults, public safety violations, needles, open air drug markets. I literally walk by one every day on Market Street. I'd rather get watch for cars than walk through crowds there.

Speaker D: Anything more about the Tenderloin?

Speaker Anastasia: We study here. 

Speaker A: We came here two years ago, then left. 

Speaker E: Where are you from?

Speaker A: Anastasiaeorgia, Canada.

Speaker D: How long have you been here?

Speaker A: Four months.

Speaker D: We're from foreign countries. How does San Francisco compare?

Speaker A: When we came back two years ago after COVID, much more was closed, lower energy. Now the city looks more alive. But I don't have a comparison before COVID.

Speaker D: Anyone have a pre/post COVID comparison?

Speaker H: Pre COVID was better.

Speaker C: Pre COVID had more businesses, activity, people, felt cleaner. Most blatant difference is people doing and selling drugs on streets. I don't care if people get high, but it shouldn't be condoned in public spaces because of health hazards. I don't have safety concerns personally, but my sister and female friends won't walk alone because they don't feel safe. For one of the richest cities in the world, that's unbelievable. Anyone should feel absolutely safe walking down the street.

Speaker Anastasia: I see lots of crimes towards tourists specifically, not locals. Is this on purpose? 

Speaker C: Tourists are targeted for crimes?

Speaker Anastasia: Yes.

Speaker C: Tourists leave luggage in cars, which they wouldn't do where they come from. People take advantage of that.

Speaker E: You do that in small towns. 

Speaker C: I don't leave anything unsecured that I'm not okay with losing.

Speaker Anastasia: I had my passport stolen. 

Speaker A: I feel Oakland is much more dangerous than San Francisco.

Speaker C: Worse than Oakland.

Speaker A: Yeah.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: Oakland you're going to get more organizing crime and gang violence. San Francisco more random. The scary thing is the mission, it used to be you walk down the street, if you're wearing red on a grip area, then someone, you're going to have a problem. If you're wearing blue in a blood area, you're going to have a problem. Now, it's not what you're wearing, it's, do you happen to run into a guy who's coming down on Fentanyl and wants a few bucks? And if you're unlucky enough, if that's the case and that's random, which makes it, to me, scary. I know. If I'm walking through the city, I wear black. If I'm walking through an area where I know there's gang activity, I'm going to wear white and black, like neutral colors. I'm not affiliated. It's not a part of the. Just ignore me, pretend I'm not here. But with the random violence, you never know.

Speaker E: Have you ever considered leaving?

Speaker D: Have you ever considered leaving?  

Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I'm getting ready for law school.

Speaker F: At what point do you get out of here?

Speaker C: Well, I'm planning on it because law school is. I'm sure I don't.

Speaker D: I'm seeing a couple of patterns here, right? A couple of problems. One thing that I'm seeing is the law enforcement that's been mentioned, like, it's too few cops has been mentioned. There's the fear of being the victim of crime. Right. There's also the fear of being the victim of violent crime, like, randomly. Right. There's also the problem of open drug use in the street, which is both a problem for people walking by and the people doing the drugs, I would say. Right. So that's kind of a two part problem there. Do you agree these are some of the themes that we've touched upon, right? Yeah.

Speaker F: If you don't mind, I would like to get specific and maybe discuss maybe more concrete things to get from the what and how. I said, I think I still want to understand your position better or what you're saying from your experience. So you're talking about kind of the services that people in local government feel like they can't touch. Are there any specific services that come to mind and what the incentive structure you think they create that you see as a problem just to kind of drill down into something?

Speaker C: To be very frank, the fact that San Francisco gives out to non resident unhoused people, $650 stipend every month. I don't know about you guys. To me, that's BS. It's unbelievable that the city of San Francisco, and therefore anybody who works and pays taxes, is contributing a part of their paycheck. For people who come into the city from outside of the city or outside of the state, to come in here and then live on the street and do drugs, it's crazy to me. But that is something that, in the direct words of one of the eleven city supervisors, cannot be touched. Because if you touch it, advocacy groups, ACLU, forget the specific name, but there's an organization that advocates for homeless rights. You're going to have them grill you, and during public comment sections, you're going to have hundreds of activists storming in screaming at you. And he said, I tried to talk about this to people, and I have people with bullhorns at my events. So that is the specific why of.  

Speaker E: The research done on how many people of San Francisco actually support that policy? The disagreement of the loudest group is obviously problematic, but it doesn't reflect the sentiment of the whole population.

Speaker C: Exactly. And that's the problem. There is a significant, extremely vocal minority that seems to be outvoicing a majority. Seems to be pretty common sense reform. 

Speaker E: Why does the system prioritize the voice of the vocal minority?

Speaker C: Because the people that want it to be fixed are at their job, and they're working, and they're dealing with their kids, and they're taking their dog for a walk, and they're washing their clothes, and they're dealing with all the day to day functions that any normal person has. But if you're a professional activist, and this is one of the problems. Professional advocacy groups, they are organizations with paying members whose job is to influence public policy. And if your job is to influence public policy, you've got nothing better to do than to go to a city council meeting and scream at people. And if you're a city council member, every single time you try to talk about something, you get people showing up with bullhorns going, fuck you, asshole. We're voting you out.
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker H: Brooke got into power.  

Speaker D: I want to open up for other topics and people to share experiences. Let's open it up.

Speaker I: I'm new to the area. When the $650 subsidy for unhoused was enacted, what was the logic? How did city officials factor in what it would solve?

Speaker H: Anastasiaavin Newsom's initiative was care not cash - housing and food stamps but not money. People didn't like it because they felt not enough was given and no direction on matching services to needs. 

Speaker D: We could match services to needs rather than just giving money. Let's discuss solvable problems for newcomers and ideas for the September hackathon on practical city problems.

Speaker F: As a follow up, how many unhoused have consistent connection and mobile devices? 

Speaker H: There are initiatives for free phones but getting people to use services and forms is hard.

Speaker A: Do you give what you think they need or money for what they actually need since they know better?

Speaker E: We stopped giving what we thought they needed and started giving money.

Speaker C: Should you be giving anything? Considering past experiments, what obligation does the city have?

Speaker D: Let's focus on practical problems rather than political issues. 

Speaker A: Are we generating problems?

Speaker D: Yes, as many problems as possible, without getting bogged down.

Speaker E: Should the city support outsiders or citizens? Education is underfunded. Do we spend on those harder to support rather than on resources for personal and public gain? Anastasiaiven budget limits, how is money best allocated for maximum social work? Funds could be reallocated from homeless services to education.

Speaker D: Reallocating funds is a solvable problem. 

Speaker A: Make a personalized algorithm to distribute funds. 

Speaker Anastasia: But how do you make that work?

Speaker H: Funding streams are complex - state, federal, city. 

Speaker D: Can we make this more accountable?

Speaker I: Do we measure the influx of out of state residents using services?
 Here is an edited version of the transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker C: The estimated population of homeless people in San Francisco, 90% of which are from out of the city and 50% of which are from out of the state.  

Speaker A: I come from an immigrant, working class background, and I've seen how the lack of access to legal aid or the inaccessibility of the law can take advantage of people like my family, immigrants, people without funds for a lawyer. 

Speaker D: Is it a question of funding?

Speaker A: Yeah.

Speaker D: Also language?

Speaker A: Yeah, and understanding the legal system. If you don't have rich parents and want to start a company, you may not understand contracts. Someone with more access to legal aid or money can take advantage.

Speaker D: These things are linked. 

Speaker A: That's one problem.

Speaker D: Thoughts?

Speaker C: Anastasiaenerative AI tools help explain contracts in plain language. The question is whether people know to use the tools this way.

Speaker A: I work for a company using generative AI for law. The issues are hallucinations and admissibility in court. We could use LLMs to make law understandable but address hallucinations. 

Speaker D: Worthwhile problem. Distribution is also an issue.

Speaker C: Any issues worth discussing?

Speaker A: You're giving them phones, give them computers.

Speaker C: A city official mentioned 311 - non-emergency services are overloaded. The app is old. Something to review is how citizens efficiently report issues and government allocates resources. Maybe a convenient chat app to submit issues to the right agency.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker F: AI would handle volume issues, summarizing requests, allocating attention. 

Speaker A: Kind of our attention.

Speaker F: AI struggles where data lacking. Volume seems good for AI.

Speaker C: AI makes mistakes, public backlash. Which problems suited for AI efficiency? 

Speaker D: This session identifies law enforcement problems for upcoming hackathon. 

Speaker E: Suggests AI city council experiment.

Speaker D: Could start with toy AI council.

Speaker E: Or doctor AI council first.

Speaker F: Where do less tech-savvy people get information if unfamiliar with AI? Meet people where they are vs expecting tech solutions.

Speaker H: 311 is where many go, refers people to services. 

Speaker D: Experiences with the city?

Speaker Anastasia: Wanted to discuss microclimates and disasters. Is that relevant here? I research wildfires and AI prediction requires decades of data. Could microclimates and prediction be a hackathon focus?

Speaker A: Just curious about solving and predicting microclimates.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```Speaker A: Microclimates interacting with catastrophes differently. 

Speaker Anastasia: The wind, rainfall, fire - it's not segregated. Each solution requires data to simulate climate like weather, rainfall, wind to help forecasting, monitoring and prevention.  

Speaker D: This group is focusing on social issues. But climate is a great topic.

Speaker H: The 311 thing matches what we've discussed. 

Speaker C: A 311 system seems straightforward - good interface for reporting, separate requests into bins by issue. Instead of a phone room, route directly to the right department.

Speaker H: It would need AI because of the complex network of services. 

Speaker D: You've identified a solution! The focus would be building it.

Speaker A: Who is the hackathon for? Can anyone apply?  

Speaker D: There's a link to apply on the event page.

Speaker A: Unemployment is a problem. Working class need career paths without paying for courses. Tech jobs are competitive. What about people in their 50s/60s?  

Speaker D: Unemployment ties to other issues. We all have backgrounds where we see problems that tools could help address. Like legal and employment assistance to lift up regular people. Any experiences where help is needed?

Speaker H: Are you thinking job training?

Speaker C: More vocational training? 

Speaker A: Not specifying a target.

Speaker E: Re-skilling requires resources. Where do we allocate them?

Speaker C: Where to allocate resources?

Speaker H: Education is important.

Speaker D: Space is open for ideas.
```
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker I: I'm not native to this area, but I do think more public private partnership needs to happen to where you're not just putting the onus of responsibility on local government, but really being able to leverage Silicon Valley to kind of provide more resources, more educational training, and just that intellectual talent really kind of contributing to start finding innovative social solutions that are kind of plaguing the city. Because I've spent the last several years in Southern California and I know Long Beach does a pretty great job of being able to bring players in the private sector, public sector, all the way from economic development to digital equity, et cetera. So I think they're a pretty interesting blueprint to kind of look at. 

Speaker E: One idea I have is maybe have an AI coaching tool that could be run by the government and then update community users which support people in getting back to the job market, providing tangible advice.

Speaker D: Yeah, access to resources, hearing here, that's a problem that could be solved quite easily. It sounds like.

Speaker C: Another problem, maybe to throw out into the ring another one of the things that the supervisor mentioned was seems like a lot of the police captain mentioned, a lot of people that are arrested are booked into the system and then essentially immediately released. And we have a high percentage of people that are being arrested multiple times. Even when they're on probation for a previous crime, they're arrested and then put back on probation. So multiple probations. And these are decisions that are made by the bench, by judges. I don't know about you guys, but I work in politics. I'm relatively politically involved, but I don't know judges. And they're elected by votes. We vote for judges. And I think most people either don't even vote or just check a box. And it would be interesting, there can be some kind of accountability service or some kind of product that allows people to understand the judges more about the judges that they're voting for. And really this can apply not just to judges but to politicians in general. There should be a structural infrastructure for the average citizen to say, hey, I'm voting for this person. What have they actually done over their last term? I know what they're campaigning on, but what have they actually done? They're a judge and they're getting 1000 cases. Are they only convicting 50 people out of 1000 cases? That would suggest to me maybe they're being a little too lax because I don't think police are hauling people up for no reason. If they're convicting 1000 out of 1000, they're probably being too strict because I doubt that there's no innocent people in the world. So some kind of accountability system for elected officials, I think could be interesting. And that affects everything.

Speaker D: So what I'm hearing here is accessibility to information about judges, politicians. It's a related problem to the legal aid stuff. Right. Political systems are complex. People might not fully understand what's going on. So maybe a problem is like, just access to that information.

Speaker A: Easy classification of the information, so you can actually read it and understand it. 

Speaker H: There are groups that try and track politicians in the Bay Area, but all those are kind of partisan in one way or another. So it would be good if. Yeah, and there's similar systems that exist for the national people like to see which way the senators voting? It'd be cool to implement that.
 Here is the edited conversation with the fluff removed:

Speaker C: This should be very accessible information. Political systems affect every issue. 
Speaker D: Politics is involved in everything.
Speaker C: How do we find technical solutions to political problems?
Speaker H: The problem is that voters don't know how their judges are doing, not what the judge is doing.
Speaker F: Information.
Speaker D: Anyone else?
Speaker E: I have another question. Do the judges have a term?   
Speaker D: And is it the same judges, or do they turn over and new judges? 
Speaker E: I have another question. On judges, do they have a term?
Speaker D: Term.
Speaker E: Is it the same judges, or do they turn over and new judges come in? 
Speaker D: Do you want to contribute to the conversation?  
Speaker A: I think it's less easily addressed by tech. I feel like there are a lot of returns on investing in public spaces with things like free WiFi where people can put laptops. Whereas now, public investments are lacking. People need places to congregate. I think there's a sense of community and belonging that you get when there's vitality that's missing now. People feel isolated.
Speaker H: The public library.
Speaker A: But libraries are underfunded right now. I'm from LA. Not too long ago there was a mental institution that was shut down and they released some patients who didn't have families to the street. There's a correlation between mental health, homelessness.  
Speaker D: So what are the concrete problems related to that in the city?
Speaker A: Because there are fewer community spaces now, people are isolated from each other. That might have to do with the lack of community we had before larger cities. Now we're isolated on our devices. There is a really bad mental health problem and higher suicide rates. How do we improve access to mental health?
Speaker D: We have about 10 minutes left. Any other civic problems that can be solved with tech?
Speaker B: You guys have covered a lot of ground today. I wish I could give cross training information from the other groups, but I haven't been in any one group long enough. I think it's great you're recording this to upload to the hive mind and maybe inform a hackathon. Your contributions will be immortal in the long term. Why don't you wrap up?
 Here is the edited transcript with the filler content removed:

Speaker B: I'll reconvene us all for a couple of minutes where we can share between groups and answer that question.

Speaker D: During this wrap up, let's just kind of go through what we think were the main topics that we discussed. 

Speaker C: Three one one is like civil service phone number. So say somebody sprays graffiti or dumps trash and you need to call the city to come clean it up. We were thinking about a more efficient way - taking the calls or texts regarding issues, scanning it, grouping it, assigning it to the proper municipality or city department, use AI to fix the problem.

Speaker A: People can be better incentivized to take action. Like if you see a problem in your area where a sign says "You have the power to make this change" and people are able to adopt the idea and make it better and more widespread.  

Speaker D: The question becomes how do you empower people to do that?

Speaker C: The only issue is you might run into code violations. Also, how many people know how to actually make fixes? I'm sure it could work in a city full of a lot of people. It's just, what percentage of people knows how?

Speaker D: We discussed the problem of making this more efficient. 

Speaker F: Space over here.

Speaker D: About legal access and access to employment and unemployment - that could probably be taught by utilizing large language models at some level.

Speaker H: There was the thing about tracking city politics the way we do national politicians. We could just set up one of these with AI.

Speaker D: Yeah. How to ensure accountability.

Speaker D: It sounds like we're kind of soft wrapping up here already. You don't have anything more to discuss, or any forgotten topics to mention that we talked about?

Speaker A: Hydrobank. 

Speaker D: Thanks for your contributions and sharing your thoughts. 

Speaker D: On that note, I'm gonna end this recording.
