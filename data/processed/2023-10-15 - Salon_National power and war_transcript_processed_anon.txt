Speaker A: We can each give some background to understand our contexts and knowledge. Today's topic is national security, defense and national power, really war. I've worked in applied physics but also sociology and economics. I'm interested in the intersection of geopolitics, science, and industrial revolution shaping world order. Some interests: society has become less violent as technology for military conquest improved, yet violent deaths decreased over time, especially civilian deaths during conflict. The decision to declare war, fight others, is a huge human evil. If we outsource that decision to things we think can react faster, there are big questions of responsibility, liability, morality. In a Simpsons episode, a guy said future wars will be fought by robots in space, and your job is to maintain those robots. That'd be interesting - wars fought just by robots in space, clear decisions, no human deaths on Earth. So some curiosities: Are we getting less violent over time? Do more intelligent weapons save lives? Will humans not fight someday, requiring our trust in non-humans? Some questions.

Speaker B: I'm Zara, a developer and sci-fi nerd with a film degree. I'm interested in bad actors enabled by high tech - not just for killing but propaganda, manipulation with bad outcomes. How to defend against that?
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```Speaker B: I'm Mohammed, AI policy expert at nonprofit The Future Society. I have public policy background, advise on AI governance and policy for organizations like OECD, UNESCO, and partnership on AI. One reason I'm interested to be here is national security often offered as reason we don't want to overregulate AI. I'd like to understand that argument better. We were instrumental in getting foundation models included in EU AI Act, which is great because it's only credible legislation right now. Our mission is align AI through better governance, focused on mitigating risks. I'm interested in security for large AI labs and foundation models, which is insufficient - not even doing basic practices like NIST cybersecurity framework. With open source AI, I'm concerned about bioweaponization and cyber weaponization because barriers to fine tuning LLMs on pathogen data or malware code are low. I think open source AI and security intersection is interesting, like cybersecurity offense dominant as novel attacks hard to defend against.```

Speaker A: I'm Leila. I have a background in economics, data science, and have been a facilitator for blue Dots AI governance and AI technical safety. I'm interested in multipolar scenarios where we have both humans and AI agents navigating some sort of complex power struggle. It seems agents will have a seat at the table and will think about other agents and humans. In my view, many have pushed back on this, but I think the first AGI creator will be the US government. I think once you get close enough, any government will see having infinite digital people is a national security threat. A company like OpenAI or DeepMind would be taken over because the US wants to maintain power and can't have you having infinite digital people more powerful than us. Of course that's destabilizing, but from their position it makes sense. I'm not super confident but want people to debate me on this.

Speaker B: I'm Ahmed. My current projects are miniaturization of particle accelerators and starting a mining operation in West Virginia. I have an aerospace background and have done some startups including hypersonics, so I have exposure to weapons systems. My take on AI risks differ from most here. I'm skeptical of AGI and more concerned with functional systems we can understand. There's quiet work in AI applicable to defense that's hard to grasp morally and strategically, especially for the US. At some point missiles will maneuver well enough to reach carrier groups, which are currently invincible. Improvements in guidance and control can drastically change strategy in 20 years. I think in more factual, direct terms. 

Speaker C: I'm Nataliaua. I run an AI startup but more relevant is I'm originally from Ukraine so have followed geopolitics intensely since last year. I know people in tech trying to help Ukraine, mostly not AI. I'm curious to learn more and can relay useful information. On violence decreasing - I've heard that narrative from Pinker but others say we don't track the right metrics. Looking at wars, deaths increased steadily until WWII, then decreased. Maybe that's the US emerging so dominant after WWII. Interested to learn more.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Chen: I'm the founder of a startup that does Chenge MCU for orbital satellites. Our first customer is with another NATO country doing board security, but we also work a lot with maritime domain awareness and also other ISR applications in the hyperspectral space. I've never really paid much thought to the philosophy of applying AGI. I've always been more fascinated by the practical, immediate applications. I will disagree with some of you who believe that the world is headed towards more of a multipolar stage. I think the US, it will still be a unipolar world for this century. Russia, China, Iran, none of them are serious rivals, or to the United States at least as a full on counter, maybe as a potential short term, medium term threat, yes, but not as a long term threat at all. I'm more fascinated by the applications of autonomous robots and warfare and yeah, advanced, more improved guidance systems, the more practical applications that we see in 10, 20, 30 years from now.

Jose: I have previously spent some time working on autonomous vehicles, and then I realized that these sort of skills actually apply very strongly in the defense space. I spent time working there, worked on two different defense startups, realized that AI in the defense space is honestly not as advanced as many people think. This is also a very interesting area, an important area that people should be thinking more about.

Leila: I've been working in AI for around five years, mostly AI recommendations and other stuff, most recently at Google X. Right now I do contracting work. I formally worked at Army Research Labs, so I am very in touch with the defense industry. I think AI has the potential to revolutionize warfare, whether asymmetrical. I don't think we need gigantic vehicles anymore when drones can easily turn the tide for lower cost. I'm interested in the Milgram experiment, in which people detached from results can cause pain and suffering by pressing a button. The concept of being detached from a drone 10,000 miles away delivering bombs is really interesting to me, and worth talking about.

```Speaker B: Hi, everyone. My name is Nataliaua. I work in aerospace now. I think I work for plant labs, and I work on flight software. Defense intelligence is basically the customer using satellite imagery. I'm curious about how AI plays its role in even something as small as edge computing on satellite AI stuff. The biggest problem right now is downlinking images, there's so much imagery available that it takes time to downlink them. There's a lot you can do with AI to process. We also have very good computer vision available in the world, but I think this can be improved and response to things happening on the ground can be made much faster than it. Curious.```
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: I lead AI governance research at an AI company called Credo AI. I'm interested in how national power and war will contribute to the trajectory of AI, governance, and development. For example, Palantir's CEO said we will not let our enemies morally outpace us in AI weapon development. Their system is called "kill chain". 

This connects to the point about who will be responsible for advancing AI. Will decreasing human deaths continue, or will the expected number of deaths increase due to lower probability, higher impact AI events? Power dynamics could shift as AI becomes more powerful. 

Speaker B: My background is physics, computer science and economics. In 2019 I interned at a military contractor using AI for signals intelligence. The interns were leading the AI work using GANs and LSTM, so I don't think contractors are as advanced as we might think. 

I'm very interested in history and strategy games. I'm curious why you think America will remain a superpower. I think China has a good chance to surpass them due to manufacturing and population advantages. I'm interested to learn the current state of military AI, and I'm not sure how aware people here are.
 Here is the edited conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Sarah: I have a background in computational biology, but I've been building and investing around AI for the last decade. I'm a partner in GI Central Partners. We have done a lot of investing around AI defense. I think the defense industry is pretty misaligned for innovation and responsible innovation. I'm interested in how to structure that differently with a new approach to financial engineering and building those types of companies. I'm here to learn more about defense AI. 

Anastasia: I'm one of the founders of ML Commons, an industry and academic consortium focused on making AI better for everyone. We build benchmarks and datasets. I have experience in semiconductors and worked on camera design for aerial imaging. I'm curious and want to learn more about the language and sociology differences between the deeply technical AI world and the policy space. 

Anastasia: I just left the Navy after eight years, including three on submarines. Thank you for building the AI tools I've used the past few years. I'm interested in two things: AI proliferation and comparing it to nuclear proliferation, especially around having policy and governance before technological proliferation with nuclear versus the opposite with AI. Also, what resources make wars possible - energy, food, logistics. I think AI will have a big impact on logistics and machine design. The jobs AI replaces are white collar engineering and science jobs. I think we'll see huge changes in supporting organizations that enable warfare, not just warfare itself.

Natalia: I work for Virgin's nonprofit foundation on criminal justice reform. I'm also interested in what makes wars possible, but from the other side - I've worked for the last 20 years on criminal justice reform.

 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

The conversation is between [name1] and [name2]. 

[name1]: My first big forays into advocacy were protesting the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. I saw tech make it harder to get good outcomes - broad screens for who was a bad guy, being applied to the wrong people and then creating more enemies. Now I see the same tools used in war scenarios increasingly brought home to police in various ways, from the guns and armor to the surveillance. It's the same people with that expertise trying to do security work at home. I'm curious about the social implications, how we determine who's a bad guy, what might lead us unintentionally to use these tools in ways that are actually making things worse. I'm impressed and curious about defense tech being built despite my opinions on its uses.

[name2]: I hope we can keep our discussion abstract, agnostic of specifics, and think about the future. Emerging themes are the changing multipolar/unipolar world and whether the recent unipolar era led to peace, asymmetric threats in technology and AGI, the morality of entrusting systems to make kill decisions, the geopolitics of conflict, and things built for defense percolating into society - some bad like machine guns, some good like nuclear power. 

Here's a thought experiment on the morality of robots fighting instead of people. The upside is no loss of your side's lives. The downside is trusting robots to decide who to shoot. What's your gut reaction - morally problematic to never do that, or could make sense soon?

[name1]: The crux is the kill decision is no longer made by a person, whether their hands or a button. I have a different take on the societal implications of not having humans go to war. One thing that ends wars is societal dissonance and war weariness from people's brothers, cousins, and others they know being sent to war. If that's just a robot or drone, we lose that context.  

[name2]: Excellent points. I think that's a great illustration of the kind of complex second and third order effects we should think through.
 Here is the edited version of the transcript:

The conversation is between ```:

Right. So there's another part of it that we lose. People still suffer in one capacity or another, right? Even if, let's say, there's no military personnel and there's a war where no one gets killed, but they're still sort of suffering on the side of, let's say, people who are oppressed or whatever. And if no one suffers as an outcome, then it just doesn't matter, I guess. Aren't we kind of just talking about the Cold War? I mean, it's like proxy wars through other countries. I'm not trying to dehumanize them, but in a sense, if we're fighting through other countries by feeding them economic resources, then it's just a question of who's spending the war and who can outspend the other person. So talking about consequences, look at the Soviet Union, serious consequences in the Soviet Union because of the spending onto the Cold War. So there are still significant consequences for warfare. It seems like there has to be some. Why aren't we currently fighting our wars with video games or simulations? Because there's gladiators. Because there's no actually. Yeah, exactly. Clearly it's not just a function of, would it be nice if we could fight this war without sacrificing humans? There still needs to be some resource that is diminished over time that ends war. Those resources are human resources. Right. They're factories that we get our clothes from. They're food farms that we feed society with. They just move to the battlefield to civilian targets. Right. Well, not only the source of power, like land, is it? Yeah, I think the Cold War is a good example. Even if we had some mountaintop where we could actually fight some war where you all agreed on some robot whatever on the mountaintop, the suffering and the resources put out would still be borne by the civilians who are redirecting their entire economy. And it seems unlikely that any country would end up being like, well, it seems the best thing for us to do is continue to fight on that mountaintop rather than attack the resources. I think game theory probably has something to say about this. It's always going to pay off for someone to defect. Yeah, sure, exactly. So there are other targets, but how are we right now able to maintain any kind of legal structure, any kind of cultural structure that says, more or less, you should attack military targets and not civilian targets, which is not a completely agreed upon idea, but somehow we did a heck of a job during WW2 of not attacking civilian targets. Wait.

```:

 Here is the edited version removing filler content:

Speaker B: There is international law that has proportionality, and I think that might relate to the moral question of who approves the kill. It seems kind of inevitable that we'll be going towards swarm and drone warfare and different methods. When it's not human resources at play, then maybe the willingness to go to war is faster. I'm probably lacking a structure about where we should go with this.

Speaker A: Conversation, because anywhere you want, this is unstructured.  

Speaker B: So there's international laws that govern warfare currently, and I think that also governs kill switch decisions, except in places like the North Korean border, where it's automatic. 

Speaker A: Again, it doesn't matter what the tool is. The thing that would stop me from deploying something into battle that was going to make random decisions is that I, the nation, am held liable by these international standards. If my goal in pursuing war is to improve my status but the international community harms me enough that it's not worth it to send out a poorly aligned AI system, I will only want to send out a system that faithfully executes my orders. That's why the military is quite focused on responsible AI and AI governance - they don't want to be seen as unethically using warfare. 

Right now, the humans driving the machines that do warfare, many of them in submarines at least, aren't connected at all. And some of them are given more autonomy than others. There's different "loaded states" of readiness, kind of like with a gun. And they actually perform that same analogy for a ship or submarine or aircraft - how close are you to pulling the trigger? How autonomous are you? Submarines are probably fully autonomous. Whereas someone in an army base is much more subject to a tighter command chain. The expectation is that if we were to go into a global conflict, we'd lose all communications, and everyone is expected to act autonomously. There's already rules and policies in place for that.

Speaker B: Is it because of the assumption that you'll lose connectivity? And when you say it's autonomous, what does that mean?
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Speaker A: The captain of the sub knows how to respond if attacked based on studying the US war plan. Let's discuss people's willingness to initiate mass destruction in an all out final battle. In a Cold War psychology experiment, a shockingly low proportion of Minuteman missile operators actually launched missiles when faced with that decision. Research shows people don't want to shoot others, but having others watching increases effectiveness. Given autonomous control, would people carry out doomsday orders? Maybe automated defense systems like in WarGames are more willing to destroy the world. Petrov didn't fire back at apparent incoming nukes, but that may be baseline behavior since the radar signatures didn't make sense for a first strike. 

My advisor did psychological studies for the military during the Korean War. They found units expended little ammo. Breaking into smaller squads increased shooting. The prevailing view was the army should expend ammo, so they restructured based on what squad size worked. 

In WWII, most soldiers shot aimlessly without trying to kill. A small motivated percentage did most of the killing. 

The key seems to be aligning units to faithfully execute plans, yet enable contextual decisions. That's the transition from today's recognition systems to future reasoning systems. The human intelligence already drives submarine decision making policy.

Speaker B: ```
 Here is an edited version of the conversation with the filler content removed:

```said there's a book or whatever. To the extent that, what is the manner through which you align that autonomous submarine with the overall goals of the military? It's called the Composite Warfare concept, and it's where each unit is responsible and autonomous. I think the answer to your question of A or B, I think almost anyone you ask would say, I want the reasoning warrior more than I want the rule following warrior. There's a lot of evidence from history to support that, actually, if you look at infantry tactics in both World War I, World War II. So the German officer corps had a tradition of this independent, autonomous reasoning kind of thing, where they're given general objectives, then left to figure out the tactics on the ground. So there's also historical precedent to suggest that's more effective. It's the same with corporations.```
 Here is the edited version removing filler content:

Speaker B: Did anybody see the Future of Life Institute's video simulation of AI bought by US and Chinese/Taiwan governments? It predicts missile launch probabilities and recommends responses. It tries to simplify complex variables into a percentage recommendation that the captain has to decide whether to trust. 

Speaker A: Yeah, it puts you in that position for a moment - you only have 5 seconds to decide.
 Here is the edited version of the transcript:

Speaker A: I think there's another side here. In AI, we live in a society where we care about interpretability, but on the other side is effectiveness. While we care about interpretability and making the right decision, there's someone who just cares about getting the job done, making their machines more effective. 

How sure are you about interpretability? It's like explaining business choices at a startup versus a public company. In DoD, interpretability is very high. Is it because it's upstream of effectiveness, or because you want to defend your reason? In defense, humans are currently in the loop. So interpretability is necessary in explaining decisions.

I'm curious about when interpretability is necessary or desirable. With driving, if you ask why a truck driver hit someone, he'll come up with an explanation. Is that distinct from an autonomous car hitting someone? AI driving could be safer than humans. Are you willing to forego interpretability? 

In the military, interpretability matters more. Is it like reproducibility and debuggability to eliminate errors? I think that thinking is different in defense than with autonomous cars, where we may accept them as safer without interpretability.  

Speaker B: I'd add that in combat, interpretability is the difference between a war crime and collateral damage. When they review the rules of engagement, it was a credible reason versus something psychopathic. Humans are liable because we can demonstrate reasonable thinking.

Speaker A: Another lesson is the more effective your weapons' threat, the less you have to use them. Like nuclear weapons preventing wars by being a credible threat. 

Speaker B: Let's debate that point further. But the issue is, if you have a more lethal robot army, you may never have to use them. Or you'll end up using them eventually.

The key parts of the conversation have been kept while removing most filler words, repeated phrases, tangents, and excessive verbosity. The edited version retains the full substantive dialog between the two speakers.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```I don't know. You can debate any of those points you want.  I'm not a huge believer. I think we kind of see that it  forbids the use on both sides, and then what you end up with is that you just use lower systems, less apocalyptic weapons to get whatever objectives you want. And we see that in Ukraine, we see that in Israel. Or you use it as an intermediary tool for economic warfare. Like, you've got to invest so much in this thing that does nothing for your economy that it depletes you and we still win floating for you. Yeah, it's best for everybody if nuclear weapons are never used, which is why they don't. But I do think there's some. It's not just like nations make decisions really optimally all the time. It's like individual people and nations make specific decisions for their reasons. I do think there's like a non zero chance that if one of these nuclear nations were brought to the brink of survival or the people within it were brought to the brink of, like, I'm about to be executed because of the things I've done. For example, that they might actually use nuclear weapons, which is bad. I'm really interested in this topic of robot soldiers because I know the Star Trek episode, I always think about it and I always wonder, why can't our wars be like that. Like a simulated war, like computers fighting each other, like you said, a video game, even though we're kind of getting to that point. If you think the way people control drones, for example, I mean, in a video game almost like setting. But the reason I think that doesn't work almost fundamentally is because war is Sort of about like, it is physical. It's literally about taking things in the real world from people by force. I think that's like, in a foundational sense, what war actually is. So you can never have something that's totally immaterial or totally nonphysical be our war. Because in the end, whatever happens with that computer, you can walk up to it with a baseball bat and hit it and then take what you want. Robots, on the other hand, are physical, so they actually just replace a human. And in the end, we could have a bunch of robots fighting each other, like massive wars with zero human casualties almost. And that could work as opposed to a simulation, even though it's like unoptimal in every way, because the winner robot army can still come in and take what they want.

Speaker A: The China Russia alliance is going to have robots, and so are we. A recent phenomenon. Power doesn't really guarantee that you win a war. If you look at Israel's War of Independence, Israel should not have won that war against its adversaries. I think one of the things that you talked about, which I want to pick at a little bit, is you said, okay, we're going to have robots that replace humans. And I actually think that in a lot of ways, the most interesting applications are not how do you have AI replace humans, but how do you have them do things that a human can't do? Like in Chernobyl, they wanted a robot to clear the roof because it was dangerous for humans. I think the point is, they didn't want to originally use a robot because it was a situation in which it was perceived to be disadvantageous for humans. But you do the math and you're like, okay, everyone can be up there for 50 seconds, so that's like two shovels apiece. You want to send a robot to 30,000ft under the sea where organic things don't do well. I look at AI in a lot of ways as like, where can we use it in places where humans are utterly unsuited? Because AI works so different - it's inscrutable. I definitely don't think that there's a really bold alignment stand of using AI or not using AI in defense or robots. I think it will just have shown much higher efficacy than anything else. The reality is that we're already using AI systems in object detection on drones. That just gets better and better where the human decision making eventually gets taken over by the accuracy of the data. And then you conventionally just make a switch that goes fully autonomous with that. The question of whether there's actually a real moral question is moot because I just think it's going to happen.

Does this retain the core content while removing fluff? Let me know if you would like me to edit the transcript further.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

```There seems to be, at least between us and full autonomous. We're just sitting back. There's clearly going to be some collaboration between some human and some AI where the AI is doing the things that the AI is much better at. And I need a way to understand what's going on there so that we can best collaborate honestly, collaborative partners. And so I like the way you framed it, because, again, it's not a moral decision there. It's like this is the evolution of systems taking on.```
 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

Speaker B: Weren't we saying for a long time that cyber warfare would be the next evolution? Russia attacking Estonia or destabilizing attacks are increasing in scale and number, that's undeniable. But robotics has been so lagging. I don't know how the military sees it. It's still like people fighting, or people with robots, like Ukraine is people fighting, right. Which I was surprised by in terms of trends, I'm surprised that we haven't just been at just mainly cyber destabilization by now.  

Speaker A: Part of what you're saying is right. Cyber is just another dimension of warfare. You have economic dimensions of warfare. Like today, I just learned that the Department of Commerce is changing the regulations on chips for AI, making them more accessible. That's another dimension. We've got cybersecurity and other things. Maybe the point is that AI and robots just add another potentially orthogonal dimension.

Speaker B: Yeah, and that is the other point I was thinking of - when we think about AI policy, the US government doesn't want to regulate because they want us to be competitive in AI technologically and innovative, and continue to beat China. The economic argument is a national security argument, because the US has a national security imperative to be technological and economic leaders.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: I agree. This is the newest branch, the cryptographic war. They're orthogonal, but not full. So when I think about what you're saying, I think it's totally true. If I had to imagine, during the Bolshevik Revolution, they took over the train stations, and by taking over the train stations, they crippled the Cyrus government's ability to get soldiers moving and logistics and information across to people. That's kind of how I imagine the easiest way to, in 2023, if somebody were to take over a state, I imagine the first thing they would try to do is control the internet and block information from traveling. I'm sure the US government has thought about that. 

With chat GPT, there's a thing called Chain of thought, which is you get to say something and then it responds to itself. So it keeps looking at its previous messages and creates a chain of thinking. That is interpretability. And the reason we do it is because Chachikati is allowed, on a macro level, to reason out a better answer by being interpretable. I'll just say it's an active area of research whether the explanations GPT creates for itself are actually related to the decisions it might make. And I think people have tried to kind of corrupt the explanations, and see whether this has more or less effect on the final psychology thing as well, is you postdate your experiences and assign rational meanings to what you did. Yeah, that's a form of rationalization. With chat GPT, the explanation comes prior. It's like, let me think through this. I think a leads to B. And so because of B, I should do C. And people have done experiments where they change that explanation, but it still does C at the end. So the explanation seems to be improving its performance, without actually being based on the explanation. So we're going to move into a future where we have these placebo explanations. I think that's what we're currently at, right? 

I think language models are nondeterministic, and what we're doing is next token prediction, right? This token is most likely compared to the last context. But what are you actually? Maybe these prompts push you closer to the latent space that gives you the answer you want. But the study investigated this - they had multiple choice questions, and originally it reasoned correctly when random, but when it was C every time, it incorrectly guessed C. But it came up with a plausible explanation that was misleading. So it was justifying after the fact. And in a separate dimension, you gave people explanations that sounded plausible but were independent of the algorithm. And people rated these systems more trustworthy. They liked them more because they felt good. That's the feeling of explanation. Those are the traditional ways to measure explainability. A better way would be, can you make better decisions collaborating with the AI because you know how it works? I want to let you speak as you. I'm curious
 Here is the conversation with filler content removed:

```Is this thought, is this reasoning, is this just a collection of possible tokens? My gut reaction is, that's what I'm doing right now, is I'm listening to this conversation. It's pushing me around in some kind of pattern matching space, and then I feel like that's actually what's going on a lot of the time, when I'm oh, yeah, I should say this, that even my own wetware is just predicting next tokens. 

There's an interesting history of surgeries where, to prevent seizures, hemispheres of people's brains have been separated. You may have one side of your body operated by one half and move your hand, and then writing and speech are in different hemispheres, so you can talk to one side of the brain or the other without the other knowing what was said. You can force behavior on one side, and then you can have the other side explain why that happened. Without knowing why it happened, the other half of the brain will come up with a reason. It'll imagine something to explain it. This has been done a number of times to see a corpus callosum split brain.

My biggest concern with handing over decision making and having more effective killing machines is do we have people thinking about grievance and how to respond to it? How do we address grievance? It seems like in Afghanistan, we were militarily superior and had people working to execute the war ethically, or navigate tribal and cultural complexities. Our presence slowly created more opportunity for others to leverage legitimate grievance. There was no out except for us to leave. We couldn't win militarily. We needed another way to come to peace. Many wars the US has fought recently have not had a military solution or ending. 

I'm curious if there's defense technology on the military or political strategy side to help foster multilateral solutions past the exceptional killing machines we're building. We can do that all day and maybe not achieve our goals without tools for winning the peace. How do we get there? 

In Oakland, violence interruption programs address grievances after somebody's been killed and de-escalate, collapsing violent crime. Before the pandemic this worked well, reducing violent crime 40-50% in areas where it was deployed. The pandemic disrupted it. Reimplementing it is challenging. In war, I think it's similar - if you generate grievance, are there tools and technologies that will help us go the other direction? 

I want to circle back on whether it is AGI or can get to AGI. I think we anthropomorphize these things when in reality they are very different than humans. Even if theoretically more intelligent, it doesn't matter. What matters are the outputs and effects, not whether they will be AGI or not. Conflict distraction on whether these things will be AGI or not.
```
 Here is the edited conversation with fluff removed:

Coming back to your point on grievances, I think nations and nation states have trauma about certain events. The US had trauma around 911. It made us do irrational things like going to Iraq, Afghanistan. I don't know if an AI system would make those decisions, but I don't know if there's a system that measures how much of an effigy we need as a society to get over that trauma or not. It's a pretty complicated question and problem to solve for, particularly with an autonomous system. 

When we titled this National Power and War, I was thinking about war, but by extending it to national power, you brought up, can we expand our circle tools? And this brings me to ideas around new tools for democracy. I brought this up before - how do you find imaginative points of commonality or cooperation amongst people that at first blush you would think would have irreconcilable differences? But there's actually some area of overlap, if only you could get to it. Maybe one aspect of these AI systems is putting more solutions out there. Because they're more rational, maybe rather than a lower barrier to war, there's a higher barrier to military intervention, and there's comparative ease of having more neutral third parties in AI tools that can help collaboration. That's more realistic than robots fighting robots. I think that there's this idea of AI and warfare where it's machines fighting machines. I think it's completely unrealistic. And then there's this idea of AI and warfare where it's providing solutions. 

People were surprised that AI systems were replacing white collar jobs instead of blue collar jobs. I think we're going to see the same thing in warfare, where AI is replacing the person that writes the treaty more than it's replacing the person that shoots the gun. You actually see it in AI tools for relationships - there are cognitive behavioral therapy chatbots.  

In the military there are different levels of security clearance. If you accumulate confidential info it could escalate to a higher level. So for a chatbot, the data repository will be secure but the chat interface will be at a lower level. The only classified chatbot I've heard of is Kirby - it has restrictions on what Congresspeople can enter.

I'm curious on a different point of national power and war - fog of war is one aspect. Satellites like Planet have a picture of every point on Earth every day. That's not real time but an incredible timeline of Earth that hasn't yet been converted into full value. I'm sure the government and DoD are the most advanced at converting that into value. But we're not yet at the point where that timeline has been fully utilized by industries.

 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

```Curious how inability to hide from each other will change diplomacy, battles, national power. Just hiding different things. Can still hide from satellites, just have to be more careful. Increases difficulty. Read this, don't know if true, but like Tom Clancy novel. Statement that US and USSR put nuclear missile silos in different places - US middle of plain states assuming guidance control stay bad, USSR somewhere else, better technology. Point is, if want to hide from satellite, just have to try harder.```
 Here is the edited conversation with filler content removed:

Speaker B: The data from the DAP, from the satellite is also being processed so well with. These days. Cloud detection, there are algorithms available now that you're able to better do things. There's also tables that use thermo imaging.

Speaker A: I'm thinking back to a radio lab episode, there was some law enforcement that was trying to break up some criminal sting, and they have a timeline literally on the minute time scale. You could backtrack until you get to a piece of information that is known. That's this person. You follow that car. Okay, that ended up here. Why did it end up here? Let's back out. Who went to that house? That's a different level of being able to extract information, which is not currently possible, not because of the imaging, but because of the reasoning that would be needed to run over these satellite imagery. I think AI has an impact here. 

Speaker B: The whole military intelligence and security apparatus as it relates to information is very not in public awareness. You don't know what tools are using or how they operate. The robot army, the battle droids are very obvious, and it's very hard to do that, too. It's not very cost effective. The extent to which physical violence as enacted in meat space and not cyberspace is going to be the extent to which satellite imagery is still useful, because you have to move the tank there and you have to get the troops there. The ability to scale up information services by producing knowledge workers who can undertake analysis from massive data sets that a human can't, and this enables you to make better informed military decisions is compelling. I would push back that satellites aren't going to be useful for monitoring wartime personnel. 

Speaker A: Satellites give you much better visibility. If you want to track deforestation or shipping containers or estimates of another country's resources, estimating across becomes possible. When you come to the table diplomatically, there's a little less posturing and a little more just we know your silicon reserves. We've been watching you. I think that's a great point. In terms of national power, we think in terms of war, but we don't think about industrial power or the ability to know exactly what you can produce, when and how much of it. Those are things that our society isn't big fans of tracking and monitoring and surveillance. I look at the opposite side of Pacific, and we have the exact mirror of society in which there is tracking, specifically China.
 

Speaker A: There is tracking and surveillance and the ability to know what can be produced, when, where and how much. My question is how that affects job creation. 

Speaker B: I agree. A tough issue with anything military is we don't know what the government has access to. I'd guess they have a system like China's here, just more secretive. 

Speaker A: In China there's one camera per two people. You can read US law to see what can and can't be tracked on citizens. The government follows the law, though it's not perfect. There are ways to infer data without breaking laws.

Speaker B: I wouldn't ask if we're breaking laws but what the benefits are of China's system that we don't consider. Our open tech gives us an advantage now from people sharing ideas openly. 

Speaker A: China spends more on internal surveillance than defense. This massive monitoring is a huge cultural difference that enables different capabilities. 

Speaker B: We should frame China as recovering from the Mao era overtaxation and starvation. Their surveillance could be a response to needing economic info. But it seems more about political control than economics.

Speaker A: It's hard to see the upside of a police surveillance state since we value civil liberties. Like Jefferson said, the biggest threat is a standing army, eroding liberties to protect against unseen threats.

Speaker B: I saw China's COVID response with lockdowns. Their surveillance let them limit movement and spread. Here it varied state by state on observance. So cultural norms affect capabilities. The question is what capabilities we overlook by rejecting such surveillance.

Speaker A: Right, there are pros and cons to government interference and surveillance. We need to thoughtfully weigh civil liberties versus potential benefits. There may be wise balances between the two systems.

 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with the filler content removed:

``` One question I have for the group is, does more transparency between nations lead to more world peace? If there was more openness about military capabilities, is that good? The second question is, will there actually be more equal information between countries going forward, or will AI leaders like the US accelerate their informational advantage and therefore have more power in negotiations? 

I think the answer to the first question is yes. Complete transparency probably leads to peace, because then why do you need war? You just acknowledge your opponent's greater power. But the problem is hidden factors. When Russia invaded Ukraine, there were many issues they didn't foresee, like corruption, dysfunctional military, high Ukrainian morale and motivation. So in theory transparency causes peace, but irrational factors remain.

For example, Britain's naval superiority meant no major naval battles, because other nations knew they would lose. But if both sides have highly accurate war gaming and information, you know who will win ahead of time and avoid conflict. 

But doesn't that incentive keeping your capabilities secret if you're weaker? And if you know you'll win, wouldn't you still want to fight for principles or values? Like with Palestine - they rejected offers of peace because of deeper disagreements.

 Here is the edited transcript with fluff removed:

```
Speaker A: ISIS motivated by afterlife idea that changes how you interpret information or measure costs. Values lead to different outcomes. You could tune societal values over time by introducing AI content. That's happening with weaponization of social media. Or it's not just one way, it's also them to us. Maybe future is transparency in capabilities and greater culture through globalization and AI systems that help bridge divides.   

Speaker B: I hope we move to global level to solve challenges. Nation state model should fade. What about security of AI or AGI? Who secures and controls it? Like with military and infrastructure, cybersecurity is unsolvable problem, offense dominant. Scarce talent relative to problems.  

Speaker A: Is your point powerful AI systems are small code that can be stolen?

Speaker B: Yes, poor cybersecurity could undermine national security plans.
```

The fluff and tangents have been removed while retaining the core substantive conversation between the speakers. The edited version focuses only on the key ideas and topics without redundant dialog or filler.
 Here is the conversation with filler content removed:

```Speaker A: I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to, because the LLMs, you don't really have to break into them. People already have them. Maybe you mean like hacking them to do bad things you're not supposed to?

Speaker B: I mean, people have open access to open source LLMs, like llama Two by meta. But people don't necessarily have access to open AIs or anthropics unless they hack into them. If we get even more powerful AI that's scaled private sector or public sector critical, that's an order of magnitude or two less expensive to train and operate, is that like, in the guise of AGI, that is rogue? 

Speaker A: Part of that where your national defense planning becomes moot because of some cybersecurity threat, is that like, in the guise of AGI, that is rogue?

Speaker B: Or is that whether we're talking about AI based systems or any digital systems, including military, digital systems can be really easily undermined, right? Dario Amode from Anthropic said on a podcast with Dora Kash Patel on August Eighth, that any motivated, not any unmotivated and well resourced enough actor, like, for example, China, could hack into any of the frontier AI labs right now. It's maybe less about who gets the powerful AI first so much as who can control or secure it. But again, military wise, security is really important. It could just undermine all of these issues.

Speaker A: I don't think there's some magic secret sauce that can be stolen or pried loose from one of these ladders. These models are unartifact and general purpose enough. Dario's perspective - there are Industrial secrets but not science secrets.

Speaker B: There's billions of dollars of investment.  

Speaker A: But proprietary IP, these are not secrets in the form of either industrial or science. There are industrial secrets that anthropic has, for instance, that he calls compute multipliers. Essentially, it makes it cheaper to train a bigger model because you have algorithmic tricks. But essentially what you're stealing is the expense of creating this thing all the way. The goal of security at Anthropic is to make it more expensive to steal the model than to train it yourself. So it's not that there was a secret sauce, it's just that it used to be not beneficial to steal because you could just train it with enough compute and time. There's nothing that actually can be stolen, I don't think that's true.

Speaker B: Well, with scaling, it's not going to be $100 million. It's going to be a billion dollars to get the next generation.  

Speaker A: Let's discuss the mechanics of if it can be stolen. But I like this topic because I'm thinking about it like, would it be accurate to say the extent to which, say, your defense apparatus could be co opted in one fell swoop or subverted? Does that really just scale with how centralized those systems are? Is that why these nuke subs are so decentralized, is because you can't just hack in and control them remotely? Is that the kind of risk we have if a superintelligence manages our defense system, and that's a single point of failure in some capacity because it's now hyper centralized?

Speaker B: There's federated and centralized models. But ultimately, what I'm scared about is if the systems are scaled and there's failure, and that will happen with AI because AI is not 100% relevant. 

Speaker A: What do you mean by scale?

Speaker B: Let's say we start having AI systems increasingly adopted across society in more and more ways - electricity systems, autonomous vehicle fleets, supply chains, banking systems, etc. So the attack surface increases.

Speaker A: Okay, so when you say scale, you mean that we are using AI much more widely and broadly. The question is, does that create an additional surface of vulnerability?
```
 Here is the edited conversation transcript:

Speaker A: My education is based on adversarial machine learning. For every AI model, there is an adversarial attack to create some expected outcome. Someone well resourced or stubborn can create attacks for models, large or small. I think the exact attack input or data manipulation could be left in the secrets - like shutting off Texas's power. You could get a temporal advantage of weeks or months. 

Speaker B: It increases the attack surface. There's work on ways if you access the weights, to automatically discover adversarial attacks for any safeguards. You can ask it for new attack ideas. One could argue we could use it for defense too.

Speaker A: If you keep it closed source, attacks are invisible and you can't defend yourself. Is the counterargument that while attacks probe it, you don't know what's wrong, especially if it's closed source? Can we distinguish between cyber attacking an AI model versus using AI for a cyber attack? Because AI can analyze data, it can put up a good defense from multiple vectors. But attacking a model may not be a well formed idea. Accessing ChatGPT is not the same as a local model. Deployment is complicated. The system versus model are different. Cybersecurity is a known issue for corporate desires, AGI risks, and national power. There's a lack of expertise in education. It's relevant to train more STEM for cybersecurity, which has higher demand than supply.

Speaker B: The demand for cybersecurity talent is much higher than the supply.
 Here is the edited transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: Many possible reasons for cybersecurity to be difficult. I want to talk about one point, which is a very interesting one, still on this cryptography topic, which is why maybe, does the attack vector increase more quickly than the defense vector? I do think in cryptography, we probably come up with a defense, at least if I were a cryptographer, after an attack or by thinking of an attack, then you think of how to defend against it, because you can't really think of a defense for something that doesn't exist. The defense comes with the attack always.

Speaker A: I see two big attacks on a large language model: you can steal the weights and now have a more powerful model yourself, or you can hack the model to get it to do stuff it wasn't meant to do. But I can think of a third attack: what if somebody trained an LLM and tuned it so that there are certain things that it's more likely to say or guaranteed to tell you? For example, for top generals, it's tuned to give specific thinking. 

Speaker A: That's like Stuxnet, which didn't immediately blow things up but slowly created issues over time. The idea of injecting subtle core information into systems could work for LLMs too. Being able to be compromised from the beginning is a major security vulnerability. You would want to train your own. Maybe poisoning is a defense against stealing weights, because how could you trust this LLM wasn't poisoned against you? I would want that.

Speaker A: You can intercept a model, change it subtly, and send it on so now they have a broken model. Maybe you can encode an attack in the weights. People respond: what if you quantize the model? 

That's the key content without the filler. Let me know if you would like me to edit any other transcripts in this fashion.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

This brings up an interesting concept about interpretability and defense. The worst case scenario is for an enemy nation to capture military code on one of these nuclear subs. You got the whole plan. Same with capturing the Enigma device during World War II. The exploit for people is very known - blackmail, threatening family, interrogation or torture. If models retain this uninterpretable capacity, and now you need to know something secret about how to access them, then is it possible that at some point the national defense strategy is stored in some absolutely uninterpretable weights of some model? We have no idea why we're doing it. 

I think, too, training AI models to get really good at defeating mechanisms deployed by other AI models is also training them to basically have the capacity to go rogue. Carl Sagan quote - the ability to deflect an asteroid away from Earth is the same as the ability to deflect an asteroid into the Earth. Training robot soldiers to hunt humans can be used against you. Can you really just train AI models to defeat national defense networks?

Something occurred to me - there's a risk profile related to the security of AI systems, especially generative AI systems for any high reliability application like defense. What if, in training bigger models on datasets including other generative models, we hit model collapse? We already have deployed systems where model collapse is possible - the idea that as you train more, the ability to regress onto something coherent becomes less viable. What if we see widescale usage of systems like AIP for military decision making, and then in 2025 it stops working or becomes much easier to exploit? 

That highlights the criticality of data. Synthetic data is differently useful than real data. With self-driving cars, we should have as little real data as possible of cars hitting people. Synthetic data is great for that. But it has weaknesses, whereas real data keeps feeding the system. I wonder with real data, if we keep training models on more of what's available, like the 0.5% of Internet data, can we better secure models? First, that seems like a lot of data to parse through and check for security.
 Here is the edited conversation without fluff:

```The threats come from poor data quality. Creating large scale competent models may always require national level resources. 

Nuclear proliferation is hard. But renting capable AI models is easy and cheap. The real barrier is obtaining quality training data.

Reproducibility of models is challenging. Adding a comma changes nothing. True reproducibility means identical data, model architecture and hardware. Training involves randomness - weights are initialized randomly, batches are selected randomly. You can't just press train and always get the same result. 

Like stable diffusion, each inference pass gives different outputs. There's art and science to achieving reproducibility.

Early ideas were that communicating 90% confidence differs from "I'm not really sure." But AI systems aren't good at communicating certainty like people naturally expect from collaborators. 

There's a risk of model collapse if humanity consumes too much AI generated content, unraveling our models of reality.```

 Here is an edited version of the conversation transcript with filler content removed:

Speaker A: We love chunk food, right? We're just almost at time, and I want to give space for everyone to share things that were new ideas or stood out. We have a slack channel which is semi active, one place people can continue the conversation, host meetups. Chenen and I are trying to build software that helps transcribe and synthesize ideas. Our long term goal is to build a growing body of accessible ideas online that people engage with creatively. The hope is we can get more people talking, generate new ideas, have that as an ongoing conversation.

Speaker B: One thing that came up was how these things will get used first is in intelligence and information synthesis, which could prevent conflict with more mutual visibility, but also increases attack surface for cyber threats, which is a huge hole in the wall. We should have a session on cybersecurity. 

Speaker C: I liked the Psyops idea of how we're trusting LLMs for education and flourishing. Evaluating how good an LLM is, is to use another LLM, which enables poisoning attacks. The subtlety of that, deployed at scale over time, is crazy. It's like interacting with recommendation engines - they don't recommend what we want, but what meets their goals. 

Speaker D: I was interested in the autonomous yet law-abiding nature of a submarine crew. The internal culture that develops must be very rich. They make lists of questions and arguments when underwater, and deliver them when they surface.

Speaker E: I loved hearing about reducing gun violence in Oakland through mediation. Maybe AI could help with that.

Speaker F: It was interesting to hear about differences in interpretability as a cultural construct, reflecting military culture. Also how critical people see cybersecurity regarding AI.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Person 1: I'm generally not a fan of regulation. I moved from DC to San Francisco to avoid it. But Yolanda's point made me think maybe there's space for evaluation or testing of what people consider AGI. A "FDA stamp of approval" could increase consumer confidence and prevent issues like people putting cones on their Waymo cars. People talk about wanting "nutrition labels" for AI - transparency or regulation. Evaluations may be most critical, rather than interpretability or explainability. If people get that government stamp of approval, maybe they don't require interpretability. 

Person 2: I had a different misconception of what model collapse was. Thank you for explaining it.

Person 1: Yeah, so model collapse is like where does real knowledge come from? It's people reconsuming each other's output along with our senses of reality. So I don't know real data is necessarily better than data processed through some system. Or models through their conversations may become more capable - learn more, but get further from communicating with us. Our data becomes a smaller percentage of their capability. 

Person 2: If you've seen that compression technique called Shigelith or something - it compresses LLM outputs into gibberish for humans, but other LLMs can understand. There's a commercial product that does that - obfuscates so you don't leak internal data but can use external services. You give the gibberish and get the same response as before.

Person 1: That makes me think of a Manchurian candidate model weight - a sleeper agent inside the weights. You could do it steganographically - hide data in the weights. Good for floating point datasets.

Person 2: Steganography, that's the word.
 Here is the edited version of the conversation:

Speaker B: I was heartened to hear that the military takes oversight, human oversight, seriously and wants transparency and reasoning behind decisions at every layer. 

Speaker A: In the military you practice things repeatedly. How many times do you have to drill for doing X before you're allowed to do X in the military? A lot of times. It's a rigor to practice something 100 times so it's natural the first time when you're under pressure. That thinking could be a helpful tool in other situations. 

One proposed regulation requires high risk systems have human oversight. What human oversight means is not substantiated much. How do you build a truly good human in or over the loop system? We have little phrases about human in the loop, but moving beyond that to have a collaboration between human and AI that is more aligned and robust isn't always clear. It would be interesting to understand the human in the loop system in the military that doesn't compromise efficiency but still has sufficient responsibility chain for defensibility and liability.

Speaker B: As a society we are unresilient and unprepared for cascading catastrophic events. 

Speaker A: Anyone else have closing thoughts? Well, thanks everyone for coming today. I'll make the recording available online. We have some smaller living room discussions coming up. On November 1 we'll have a much bigger discussion with up to 100 people where we can break into discussion circles and have a mini panel to share what was discussed. The theme is human flourishing, relating to personal development and wellbeing. It's on our calendar. If you subscribe you'll stay in touch. Joining our Slack is another way to get first notice of new events. Otherwise it's just a big list of names we might not recognize. If you want to get dinner nearby, there's restaurants in Hayes Valley. Or you're now free to go back to your lives. I'll set up over here if anyone wants to join Slack.

Speaker B: Yeah.

Speaker A: But sign up, it's good to have people. Still struggling with product market fit for an AI GRC startup. Most companies aren't looking for a GRC platform right now.
