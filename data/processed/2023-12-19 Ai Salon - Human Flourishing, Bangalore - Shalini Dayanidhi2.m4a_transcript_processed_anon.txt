Names have been changed to preserve anonymity.

 

Speaker B: Ever.
Speaker A: You're essentially talking about a lower hierarchy, I mean, a lower rung of the hierarchy of needs. Right. Which is basic safety. And we are talking about digital safety and psychological safety. But you're like, I think you had mentioned it earlier as well, where you said before talking about education, we have to talk about health. Like these people cannot stand, so they can't learn. So I think for you.  

Speaker B: Yeah. So I think there are these power structures that are inbuilt in our society, and unfortunately, they could be caste based, class based, gender based structures, religion based and all that. So I think somewhere AI can question those structures and make our society more inclusive. And that's sort of very exciting for me to think about what can be done.

Speaker A: But it could also re emphasize the same bias.

Speaker B: Yeah, but if you look at it, I mean, I'm very excited by how India is progressing. Right. I mean, if you look at, say, technology today, right? So there was a huge gap in terms of exposure between somebody who stays in a city like Chennai or Bangalore or somebody who is in, say, some tier three city or some village or something, because everybody has an access to information. That exposure level difference has gone down dramatically, basically, in terms of that. So I do feel that I understand from a standpoint that technology can also be, it's a tool at the end of the day, a tool for good or bad. But generally, I think that it helps. That's the basic thing that I've seen. I'm more kind of worried about this entire the other panels, the politics and government and AI and stuff like that, where people are getting too influenced by what they see on WhatsApp.

Speaker A: I don't even know if that's an AI thing or a manually led.  

Speaker B: So bad. How bad can the AI thing be or how good.
