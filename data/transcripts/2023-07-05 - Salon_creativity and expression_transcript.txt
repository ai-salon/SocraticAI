Speaker A: E. So the theme today is creativity and expression. And I have a few kind of questions that I think can help us dive into this. But before, even though we've introduced ourselves a little bit, let's introduce ourselves one more time. In this time, I would love you to talk about why did you decide to come to this AI on what attracted you to the theme of creativity? And I think that's enough so I can go first. So I'm ian. I have been running the AI line for the reasons I just said. I think I work in the AI governance space, which is kind of a risk focused perspective, which I think is really important. But I've really benefited from being around even rabid techno optimists who are so far away from my own view, because I feel like it gives me a real sense of both the expansive possibilities that might happen from AI. And yeah, it just feels energizing. And creativity in particular, of course, there's the artistic side, and that's been a big conversation that cross cuts kind of jobs. What is creativity, intentionality, et cetera. But I think creativity is a broader thing. It's not just artistic expression, it's like fundamental to all we kind of do. And so this partnership that I found myself having with Chachi BT, I'm starting to think, like, does this expand my creativity? Does this project me into Chachi BT's world? Like, actually constrict my creativity? I don't really know, but that's what I'm excited about from this conversation. Maybe we can go around.
Speaker B: Sure. Hello, everyone. My name is Asidra. As my day job. I work as a software engineer with Salesforce. Have dabbled in the AI ML space before I got my master's in computational science, which was a lot of math behind ML and things like that from Georgia Tech and then was working in NLQ, which is like natural language querying of how do you take questions and convert them into SQL and then without having to know how to query things and stuff? That's my area of focus for the last couple of years. In terms of creativity, I'm passionate about creativity in the sense that creativity in any form really makes life beautiful. And just creating something with your hand or even offline as a soft copy is great because it makes you think in more parallel directions versus more structured thoughts. So I am always in the hunt for pushing my creative streaks and stuff. I've not really done a lot of exploration on combining AI and creativity, and that's what I was curious about, of how other people are doing it and seeing their opinions about it. So that's why I'm here.
Speaker C: Great. My name is Annabelle and my day to day job is actually working as a startup lawyer. So I work for a firm where we primarily work with innovators and startups in actually making sure that they don't get into trouble later down the line. But they can actually just move forward and realize their opportunities. My background was I was previously working in data protection in a startup. So I got in through a non legal route and then fell in love with startups in the tech world through this way. And yeah, like, I actually moved to San Francisco around three months ago because we're expanding to the US.
Speaker D: From where?
Speaker C: From Prague. But I'm British.
Speaker D: Liking it so far.
Speaker C: I'm loving it.
Speaker D: Hasn't intimidated no, no.
Speaker C: The energy of people here is really amazing. Everyone's so passionate about the problems they're trying to solve and conversations like this is something I haven't experienced before. And for me at the moment, I'm really interested in how we're developing AI systems in a way that is beneficial for society. So outside of work, I'm looking at the intersection of law and technology and actually how technology is normally regulated or governed, so it actually benefits people in society. So books like Invisible Women, for example, about how different products, how they're created, can cause biases against certain people in society. And I want to be part of that movement to make sure that that doesn't happen out of what we're experiencing now because there's so much rapid change. And then my kind of link to creativity is when I was growing up, I was really heavily into music, so I played the flute and saxophone. And I've always been interested in actually how using technology, whether that is still created. So when I was studying, I did a year in Helsinki in Finland and studied AI and technology, looked into how copyright laws could be influenced by the use of generator, the AI in creating music, and whether that would be something that could still be protected legally and actually how the law would react to that. And then I started to dig deeper into what is actually creativity and what it means to build something cool.
Speaker E: I'm Nikhil. I came to the United States about eight years ago for my master's. My bachelor's was in computer engineering, which is like the Indian equivalent of computer science, but I've, I guess, dabbled in creative pursuits throughout my life. Specifically, I had a job writing jokes for a social media company. I've even, I guess, written a book at some point and published short stories. I dabble a lot, I think, in creativity generally. Like, right now, I'm doing 35 photography and stand up comedy. And my general interest in this is around computational methods and how they can be used to augment creative processes. So I've built Twitter bots in the past that sort of exploit some of that grammar to create, I guess, different tweets that repeat specific patterns. And now with, I guess, large language models, I'm more interested in how that can be scaled and perhaps applied to other forms of creative output. Did I miss anything?
Speaker A: Hello.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker B: Was the original question just introducing yourself and what brought you here? And why are you here? Because of the topic, which is creativity and.
Speaker A: Yeah, generally pretty curious. I've done a lot of community building work for founders and engineers in SF. Did this thing called Screwball Valley, if you've heard of it, and have just been tinkering with a lot of sort of projects, ideas, concepts, like all those conversations about how the world's going to change, ideally economically existentially, for a while now.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker A: In general, creativity is just a fun little outlet. I also like the idea of my ideal world would be like, taking away all the other implications about economics and life, what's going to happen to humanity in general. I just like the fact that if I can think about it, I think it'll exist. I really like that. Especially with maybe like a concept for a joke. That extra 40 cycles of drafting or whatever it takes to get to the work is brutal. So just minimize something. They go, there's a chair over here by paper for all creative outlets. Really fun. Definitely genius music. I think there's just new forms of creativity that's going to come of it. And the tech exists means right. Human expression is going to be like the final thing to believe on the table for interpretation. So pretty excited to see where things go. Cool. Thanks, Akil. So just we're going around. We'll come to you last. But yeah, people are just introducing themselves and talking about why they decided to come to the AI salon today and specifically what attracted them to the theme of creativity and expression.
Speaker C: Also, I've met Ivan, by the way. So cool stuff I could do.
Speaker A: Can we quickly just names for the.
Speaker C: People who just came in astra I'm Annabelle.
Speaker E: Nikhil.
Speaker A: Nikhil, okay. I'm Ian. And we'll continue. Oh, thank you.
Speaker C: My name is Diana. I also recently moved here. Definitely an adjustment, to say the least, in terms of, like, I do a lot of different things, but I think the thing that I focus on the most right now is I run a meme community, like me, and I don't know how, but every person in this community is an AI software engineer.
Speaker A: Everyone is a software. Just everyone.
Speaker C: Like 80% to 90% of these people that come to my events are in this space. So that's been interesting to me to kind of navigate. I don't know how that's part of the reason why I moved up here. I also recently got an offer from a job, like on Friday, literally, for an AI company. Thank you. So I don't know if you guys have heard of it. It's called deep learning.
Speaker A: AI. Andrew Ames.
Speaker D: New company.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker C: So I'll be scaling the Deep Learning community to new heights. So that's part of the reason why I'll be staying here.
Speaker A: Very sweet.
Speaker C: I came here for the reason to get a pulse on real events, not like utilitarian events like you mentioned, of connecting founders and investors and whatnot. And as for the creativity, I create my own memes. So I've obviously looked into Chat GPT for different types of connections, but it doesn't have a pulse on that. And so I still think there is a human touch of like, what is a cultural element? How do you incorporate that right. Without having it to be like I don't know, it's just not generated yet, I guess you could say. Although I have a very niche, I think, subset of content, I guess you could say. So I'm always curious to get people's takes on what does culture mean when everything is automated? What does culture look like when you have that standardization of writing and whatnot? So I'm happy to be here.
Speaker D: Are you embedded with the Web Three community as well?
Speaker C: I used to be a couple of years ago.
Speaker D: When you talk about memes, I was thinking that's also kind of an inherent part of a lot of communities there.
Speaker C: Yeah, I used to be. I took some time off from working my whole career. I've been scaling communities. You get burned out on people.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker C: No, I laid low for a while, but I'm back in the game now.
Speaker D: Good.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker D: So I'm William, I guess. Real in. I was born in China, I grew up in the US. And then I've been working in Hong Kong for the past couple of years. I was in New York, Wall Street for most of my career, and then recently I moved into Web Three into crypto. So I work at a centralized exchange called Crypto.com. My interest in kind of the creative space, I don't play a musical instrument, I don't do stand up comedy. But I do like to write casually from time to time. And I realized that's something that stayed with me throughout all the years that I haven't been back in touch with writing. I mean, I still write from time to time, and people ask me to do certain things, and I'm always excited whenever I can contribute kind of from that creative part of me. I think it's all the years of working in finance where it's just so, as you say, utilitarian. There's like no ability to express yourself. And then my interest in Salon or AI. Salon? Yeah, with GPT now, I've used it to just give me some ideas for brainstorming writing topics, and I've asked it to write stuff, and it's really good. I would say that a lot of the stuff that I used to write, if I just give it a certain level of prompting, it probably does it just as well, if not even better. I'm not intimidated, I'm not insecure. It's more like, okay, well, how do I explore this now? How do I take my writing to another level? And I'm just trying to explore what is creative because some of the stuff I've asked it to do, it's pretty darn creative. Like, I can say write a shakespearean sonnet about life in Hong Kong related to climate change or something, and it does that. And I was like, okay, well, what do I offer in this kind of new paradigm where a lot of this can be outsourced to GPT? So just some ideas.
Speaker F: Do you plan on implementing any of that into blockchain technology?
Speaker D: Oh, no. Sorry. So my day job is, like, blockchain web three. My interests are, like, everything I just described with writing. Yeah, web three. I know what you mean by getting burned out by it. Certainly I entered the space right around the peak of the bull market. I think I'm still embedded in that community, but I just feel like right now, AI clearly is the thing to focus on and how that evolves into how it will fit into web three. I'm very optimistic in exploring opportunities there, but at this point, I think it's just try to understand as much as possible what AI is capable of and then fit it later.
Speaker F: I think I've been there. I've been building the team for the last three months. I guess we're working on autonomous interfaces for retail and small business to replace websites, something to interact with people's personalized agents. In the future, I don't think websites will be the same. You won't interact with them like person would interact now. You'll use your personalized agent or autonomous systems to interact with websites. So we're trying to do, like, a shopify with turnkey solutions for retail and small business so that we can make these interfaces with use cases. And I've been on this journey for, like, six months. Maybe imprompt engineering was, like, the start of it. What you can get out of the systems are, like, LLMs are only as good as your input and how well you can phrase what you're trying to.
Speaker D: Get out of it.
Speaker F: So I needed a community to help build. I think it's hard to try to do anything on your own in any space. So I'm recently relocated here as well from Florida. And I feel like this was an interesting concept for a meeting because I feel like soon creativity will be out, people will be outperformed and out produced by all creative material being output. So these agents and autonomous systems will have to decipher research, decipher music, decipher information for us, because how will the world look and how will people understand creative works when there's, like, ten times that amount being produced daily by things that aren't humans? So that's kind of my question for today, and I think that's an interesting concept.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker A: Sorry, I missed your name.
Speaker F: Len Cole.
Speaker A: Len Cole.
Speaker F: Len Cole, nice to meet you.
Speaker A: Nice to meet you. Yeah. Sorry I started this.
Speaker D: Okay. I know you, but my name is Far Tay. I'm a Norwegian anthropologist, or I'm doing a PhD in anthropology.
Speaker A: Right now.
Speaker D: I'm interested in artificial intelligence, LLMs, I guess in chat bots specifically, and how people interact with them. But I'm also more and more interested in know, we talked about how this know, affect creativity and culture and mass production of these things. And I feel like it's happened before and people have been writing about it before. I was thinking about this writer called Walter Benjamin who wrote about mass production of culture, know, back in the day when they were talking about factory production of art pieces and stuff like that. So maybe that's something to think about when thinking about these AIS. And I use chachi, BT in my writing when I'm writing academically now and also when I'm just writing for fun like you do for prompting myself and prompting them. Then kind of asking, is this a good idea? And then also put in a paragraph here and there. Is this a good phrasing? And then kind of COEDIT with the machine. COEDIT with the machine, yeah, and I think it makes me more productive. It really does. It's a really helpful tool. But then is it making me into a creator or an editor? Like, am I essentially just becoming an editor? Editing is also a creative process, I guess. But am I just editing my own thoughts? Am I having my own thoughts? Is this me doing this? So I'm interested in culture and creativity in that way.
Speaker A: Cool. Thanks everyone for introducing yourself. And I'm awesome hearing everyone's kind of background.
Speaker D: Do you have a WiFi?
Speaker A: Yeah, I do.
Speaker D: I do.
Speaker A: So the WiFi is this way to the Internet. Here. I'll just tell you what the password is. If other people would like, this is your chance. But I don't think let me see. So yeah, right now if you're like on T Mobile or a few other things. This spot is awful. So it's a vacuum forcing us to be in person. But there are ways around it as you go. Hold on.
Speaker F: I guess quickly you guys into oh.
Speaker B: Yeah, I'm a software AML engineer. And in terms of creative pursuits, I'm into writing occasionally and baking and food.
Speaker F: I love food. I think I've met you.
Speaker D: Seen you before though.
Speaker C: I'm Annabelle and my day to day job is working as a lawyer with startups.
Speaker F: Oh, nice.
Speaker C: But I also play the flute and saxophone. And I started two podcasts, so I did like a lot of editing with this.
Speaker D: What's the content of the podcast?
Speaker C: Also intersection of law and technology, but more to upskill lawyers on how to understand tech to connect.
Speaker F: I was talking with a lawyer yesterday, I was like, I want to download you brains.
Speaker A: Okay, so we just went around and did intros. Let's do it. I think it will benefit everyone to do this one more time. So I will start. We can now include the full group. I'm Ian. Let's just do names. I think that'll be enough.
Speaker C: Farte astra Annabelle, nikhil.
Speaker A: Nikhil.
Speaker F: Kyle, Diana, william Lynn, Colton.
Speaker A: Cool. So, yeah, we just went through where everyone is kind of coming from. And I kind of wanted to start this discussion helping us be on the same page a little bit about creativity. What is this phrase? Because that's always the biggest thing with all of these AI salons. Our themes are like justice or relationships or whatever. So we have to spend a little bit of time figuring out what we mean. So one of the big kind of differences that I hear when people talk about this is creativity, the concept versus certain artifacts that are like the reflection of creativity that are typically associated with being a creative person. So people will say, like, oh, I'm not creative, I don't draw or I don't play an instrument or something like that. But they might be very creative in other ways, but it's not like associate. It's not the typical associates of creativity. And I think that becomes pretty important for our conversation here because we could have a conversation. I think we probably will touch on it, on how does the AI systems interact with those kind of typical pillars of creativity, as Fontaine was saying? Like kind of mass production of whatever culture is, which also has this association. Like what are the artifacts of culture? But there's this other aspect of what is creativity? What is the creative process? And do we feel like AI can be creative? Do we know what it means for us to be creative? Maybe if we bring that back. So I'd like to first the first question I just want to throw out there is, can we start to define creativity for the purpose of this discussion? And whoever wants to be brave enough to put out their first, I'm sure it won't be our final definition, but I would love to hear someone's guess of what you can.
Speaker F: I think, in my opinion, creativity is just using your imagination for any process, whether it be work, coming up with anything that's like an artifact, but just being able to imagine something different or a new way to do something that you already have a process defined for that's creative. To me, just changing the script up for anything.
Speaker A: So creating something new, just changing your.
Speaker F: Process, maybe just coming up with a different way to think about anything. And there's creativity, in my opinion.
Speaker D: I like that because I was also thinking about, like, there's a certain element of playfulness, at least when I think about creativity, it's like you're saying it's like creating something, playing with something, coming up with new things, maybe even in that process with essentially like just playfulness. Playfulness and imagination.
Speaker A: With creativity, myself, yeah. Does that ring true for others, the playfulness and imagination?
Speaker C: Yeah, I think for me it's the same, but it's also adding that experience that you have from life, like something that you've already gone through, creates that creativity. And that's why we all have different ways of evolving a concept, because we experience life in different ways.
Speaker F: Something without experiences couldn't be creative. Like a baby, maybe that's one day old.
Speaker C: Maybe, possibly. But it's more yeah.
Speaker D: Consciousness is creative. Life is creation, I guess, for me. Frame it. Where do you want to start? That's the start. We can go out to the art world and, like, marketing and getting into this. I mean, but it's like, where on.
Speaker A: The spectrum, I think I'm willing to bite the bullet and say that there does need to be I associate intentionality a lot with creativity. So, for instance, if a lightning bolt hit something and it created this unbelievable pattern that's so beautiful, never been seen before, that's not creativity. I mean, it's an artistic thing. And maybe someone else who photographed that thing, maybe they're shocked, would say that's found art.
Speaker D: You are the creator because you found it.
Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. The finding of it might create the art, but that's where the intentionality there.
Speaker D: But you as you saying that that's art. You created it.
Speaker A: Totally. But that is the art.
Speaker D: AI is an artistic you have to have a conscious you have to have a consciousness to make it creative.
Speaker A: Yeah, this is what it's like.
Speaker D: It's just like quantum mechanics. The waveform doesn't fall.
Speaker F: But that's artifacts as well, versus just being creative, like the two different types. You were saying that lightning bolt would be an artifact of not creative, though. Because it's not intentional.
Speaker A: That's what I'm saying. My perspective would be like to say the lightning bolt creating that thing is not a creative act. Creativity did not come that's not what I want to call creativity. That would be too broad a scope for me.
Speaker B: But when you talk about intentionality, can you define that more? Because you might be going out to create something specific, but you come up with your ideas and end up with something completely different.
Speaker A: Yeah, maybe the epitome of this kind of creativity is Pollock. Right. He had a goal to he's like, I am going to do drift paints, which is an intention to enter into this space where there's a bit of control, but a lot of not control. And then in some ways, that's the point. Right? Not no control. Pollock definitely knew a lot about how drips would happen. We would not be able to drip paint the way Pollock does. But there are other people who did, like these I forget her name. There's another artist who did these waterfall, where she would take these pieces of huge brushes and put them onto her canvas, and it would rain down. And of course, she wasn't responsible for the specifics, but there was unintentionally at some scale.
Speaker D: So what about art where something surprising happens? So your intention was to make something, but then something else happens, and then you kind of just go with it. Would that be similar to what you just said? Maybe. I feel like the intention there was to actually see where it drips. But if something gets broken or ruined or it does something totally unexpected and then you just kind of go with it. Is that found art or whatever?
Speaker A: Maybe that relates to Kyle's point.
Speaker D: Yeah, there's something, but we have the power to kind of make something. We might have created it, might call it we might have created it, or we might have found it, but we're the consciousness that made it art.
Speaker A: Does anyone think that the creativity either needs to or is greatly increases its value if it is human in some way? Well, I mean, we're clearly coming to versus AI systems, but I guess here's an example. There's like a famous story about Picasso. He did these doves, these short doves, little doves that he would draw, and they were very quick for him to draw. Drew them in a moment, 10,000 if the money is at all a reflection of our value of the creative, like, very expensive kind of things. So clearly our value of the creativity isn't in the effort in the moment. That's for sure. I mean, maybe it's reflecting our value of the effort of a lifetime. Right. It's a reflection of Picasso's life experience that is being reflected here.
Speaker D: But I think maybe it's also the uniqueness of the object. It's like something, an object that can't be recreated, at least in our kind of cultural space, that has value. And the history of the object, like, for example, painting, it's not just the image, the painting, but it's also the history of the object itself, the canvas, the frame. And maybe it's like a 100, 200 year old painting, then that adds value to the object at least. But then that's not to do with the creative process. I guess that's more just like what we value as art.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker D: Important point. That's the story. The story is going to be becoming more and more important. What was the story behind the image? Yeah.
Speaker A: So maybe those will become the currency of the realm for the artifacts on the side, as they always have.
Speaker D: Artifacts are becoming commodity now.
Speaker C: It's the story.
Speaker D: You got an artifact, but what's the story to this?
Speaker A: Yeah, sorry.
Speaker D: Go ahead.
Speaker F: I value the AI's opinion and creativity as much as any human, and I think it'll be even more valued than humans soon. That's my thing.
Speaker D: Oh, it's amazing. It's got all art history. Like, it knows how to lay out design, lighting, color coordination, but you don't.
Speaker E: Buy or like a Van Gogh because of his skill, I think.
Speaker D: Right.
Speaker E: There's an inferiority to his work that reflects on who he was as a person. And you identify with some aspects of it.
Speaker D: And.
Speaker E: I don't know if I can probably be like, oh, this model was trained for a year, and it's like a trillion parameters, which is why I would care about its output. So I think I agree with what you're saying, which is there is an aspect of creativity which also lies with the audience and not just the creator, which is how much value do you put on something. And we already do this right, like, people paint, but so do elephants. But you wouldn't pay the same amount of money for a painting that an elephant is making.
Speaker D: I mean, like with Picasso, it is a story. He broke the rules, which in our society level, he did like five times.
Speaker A: Which is like I don't think any.
Speaker D: Artist has done that. I don't like his work, but has an artistic impact on society. I think that breaking the rules breaking rules is interesting. Yeah. Because but to be able to break the rules and be accepted by society effectively, you have to know the rules to be able to break the rule. That's what Casa said. You got to know the rules to break. Yeah, that's where I heard it.
Speaker A: Probably maybe that's related to your original kind of definition now of your ability to see things new or change your process or whatever. Like, if you were just a random painter to stay with painting just as our just random painter, and you painted things like Picasso, we wouldn't really see that as creativity. You're just a random out thing. But if you instead are like, I understand certain structure, and I am going to decide to combine these things in this way or move against it or whatever, which I think still perception of.
Speaker F: Creativity, but I think still creativity if you don't have no idea what you're doing.
Speaker D: Right.
Speaker A: It's still a creative process.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker F: And culture is shifting towards what and how that creativity is defined. Like I was saying, AI in my opinion, I think you asked, like, do we value human creativity versus AI? And I think most people don't value AI creativity just yet. But culture will shift towards that way when we see the outputs from all the things that are going to start coming out and happening.
Speaker A: I guess what I think will happen is the ideas of the typical artifacts that were associated with creativity, like drawing a thing or whatever, making a logo, will no longer be associated with creativity. Because if an AI system can just create these things over and over again, then you no longer will see logos or whatever as outputs of a creative process and instead will just be like a new it's a new factory that's printing out logos.
Speaker D: It's a story from a science. Buy into that story. Otherwise, just pixels. Yeah, because I wanted to kind of touch upon intentionality experience story again, this thing about knowing that the artist or like the artist in the creation of an art, like art piece, I guess it's like the experience kind of like feeling knowing that it should be there or learning that. I guess maybe AI can do it better. I don't know. But there's something about that story about. The artist as well. Right. But then maybe you can think of the people who made the AI as the kind of people you can think about the teams behind that and their creativity. I don't know. I'm just sorry. The levels of nuance. Yeah, because let's take chess computers right now. I think they have computers playing computers, but they also have teams of humans behind them. And it's like a story there. It's almost like Formula One. It's the machines. Right? It's also the humans interacting with the machines. That's like the story right now.
Speaker A: I don't think it's a story. I think it's the case that human machine teams do better. Soon. That won't be the case. But it is a machine on its own. Yeah, but it is the case right now for chess.
Speaker D: Chess?
Speaker E: I thought the machines are quite already better. Already better?
Speaker A: Yeah. I think right now this might have changed in the last year. Human chess hybrid teams, they outperform the best chess machine on its own. I mean, the human is still using the best. Yeah, totally.
Speaker C: Sorry.
Speaker D: I just had a thought with chess again, because I'm trying to translate it into art and why we value art and creativity. I don't know about you guys, but it's kind of boring watching two computers play chess against each other, right. But then when you include the teams, suddenly it's like engaging again. So thinking about AI generated art, we might just find it kind of boring.
Speaker A: I feel like this thread sorry, no. This thread of what do we value? And this storyline thread is really about the artifacts. Like, what do we call art, how do we value them? Which is a bit different than the creative process in general. I don't think the creative process is merely a story. I think the creative process is like something. It's something it doesn't have to be human, specifically human. I'm just trying to understand what are the components of that process that needs to be there. And maybe some of you are happy to say that if a bunch of billiard balls came together and bounced in different directions, that's creativity to me, that doesn't sit completely. Right. I posit, unintentionality. It doesn't need to be like a perfect goal. And I don't think that intentionality needs to necessarily be human. But I put that out there as, like, being some partner. I would love to hear, are there other parts that you think are necessary before you want to call something creativity? Or is any new creative output, whatever is the creation of that? Are you willing to call creativity?
Speaker F: You would go back to dig deeper into consciousness. Then what do you define as consciousness? And we can go there because, like you were saying, consciousness is intentionality to create anything. But consciousness is deep because we don't understand. Consciousness is a tree, conscious is a rock.
Speaker D: Consciousness but I don't see anybody addressing a machine can be self aware, not be what we are, for sure.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker D: So what is that? Still alien?
Speaker E: No, what is that?
Speaker D: So there's like this idea of consciousness or sensei. If somebody knocks me out and I have no I'm not taking in any data and I'm not giving out any data, but I'm still human, still perception.
Speaker A: Yeah, I think perception is really the key there for all this is consciousness, right?
Speaker D: Maybe we need a new word for it and a better definition. There's a difference between being self aware and conscious. I don't know what the words are.
Speaker F: People can't define consciousness as much as they can define I mean, when we define consciousness, then you can define creativity. But people don't have a definition.
Speaker D: For.
Speaker A: Me has this book called The Creative Habit, and I spent, like a.
Speaker D: Rick Rubin oh, that's awesome.
Speaker A: Awesome book. Yeah, I spent a couple of years just, like, deep diving, trying to find neurological reasons, how to be more creative, how to be more productive and all that stuff.
Speaker D: That book's magic.
Speaker A: And that book's pretty interesting. So we discovered Rubin a couple of years ago for this book. And so it's kind of about like you just be open to reception via here in the ether. It's like some Pragmatic stuff where it's like you can just listen and kind of try to calm your mind down and just let those different sounds you can kind of overlay the sound of a random thing outside. Maybe that comes based musically or on or something. I'm kind of taking a lot of things out of context here.
Speaker D: How many people have read the Rick Rubin book? You buy it?
Speaker F: I heard of it.
Speaker B: I wanted to have it by Twilight Harp.
Speaker A: What?
Speaker B: There's another book called Creative Habit by Twilight Harp. I've read that one, but kind of.
Speaker A: Surprised that I've only read a tiny book by John Cleese, which was also on the creative process, which is how was it?
Speaker D: Did you recommend it? It was great.
Speaker A: It was also, like ten minute read. Maybe one thing. The last word is like he basically quotes, like, taste the difference. Like, this person just wants good taste.
Speaker D: Perceptor, like, just found art. Who's saying it's art?
Speaker A: Yeah. Well, maybe let me try to remove intentionality for a second and relate to this point, which is for a second, let's think about creativity almost like empirically or pragmatically and and and state for a second that it's actually very difficult to bring into life new things that are worthwhile in in some way, like worthwhile for humanity. Let's just put it in the context of humans. It's actually difficult. So you're not going to be able to throw billiard balls together and get things out that are useful in general. And the occasion when a lightning bolt strikes and is really beautiful, that's very rare. It's actually very difficult to set up the situation, to create forget creativity, to create new things that are worthwhile.
Speaker D: That thing about lightning strikes me.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker D: The beauty here is fucking amazing. Like, every sunset here must just fog down. And the fog has its own beauty. Beauty is every all the time. It's insane. So against the story, it's like, who chooses that to be that important?
Speaker A: Yeah. So let me try and make it less artistic and subjective and talk about the creativity of, like, science or engineering or something where you're like it takes a lot of creativity yeah. To remove the subjectivity a little bit. The creative process is also necessary to add something to our capabilities as humanity. Right. Our engineering might, our control over the world. That is surely a creative process. And it's nontrivial to add on to that capability. And so if we were able to create a system yeah, sure. But instead of calling I'm trying to sidestep that for a second. Instead of defining things that are not art, just talk about clearly that requires creativity. If I made a system that without intentionality, without consciousness was able to just shit out new scientific discoveries, new engineering things, I would say that thing we've made a creative machine, totally. It has no intentionality, but it is able to be able to see new relationships, new worlds, and create new things. Does that strike true?
Speaker C: Does that feel but maybe it's creating creative outputs. But is it like expression?
Speaker A: Well, we haven't even talked about the word expression. We could talk about it now because.
Speaker C: I think maybe that's the distinction, that you can bring new ideas, you can look at what is currently existing to create something new and create new ideas. But then what makes us human and actually how we create it is what we've experienced. And that was what I was trying to explain earlier and what we've seen before and then how we actually build something new. And maybe that I can't put it into words, but it's like that human.
Speaker A: Quality that really makes it like Nikhil brought use the phrase like the reflection of its interiority or something like that, which doesn't necessarily need to be human. Like, again, other things. As soon as you think something has an interiority to express, when you see the creative output being a reflection of that interiority in my fake science machine, that's a creative thing, I guess, in some ways that expresses a certain kind of interiority. Clearly, it has a sense of how the world works and evolves in some interesting way, that it's able to bring things together, but it's not reflecting anything human.
Speaker D: This is very heady for me, be fun. And I thought this would be an art meeting to find out what people's experience in life is where are they with art in their life? What is their human like? We're talking about humanity. What's your humanity with art?
Speaker A: Yeah. We covered this a bit as just as some people here are musicians or hobbyist musicians. Nick hill here. Just comedy on the side. Diana has previously ran a social group around meme, creation and is interested in just bringing communities. So I draw and I play guitar. So everyone here has some kind of reflection. But sorry, we're not going to go through it again.
Speaker C: Sorry. What do you do?
Speaker D: Why? What can I journey?
Speaker F: That's why art is on your brain.
Speaker D: I love color, I love Jason. And story is more and more important.
Speaker A: Yeah. And by the way, I didn't want to completely say we don't have to talk about art, but right now I want to keep the conversation because I think creativity often immediately becomes an art conversation and I just want to keep it a little higher level for now. And then we can kind of go into kind of more specific verticals of creativity.
Speaker D: So I guess want to go back to the human experience thing that seems there and intentionality as well. And interiority. Is it only humans that can be creative? Or can animals be creative? Is a beaver creative? Or is it just an automaton building dams? But it's also not every river is the same. So it's not building the same dam over and over again. Another question is consciousness, is it substrative matter? Like animals? Why would there be a dichotomy? Why would there be a barrier? Why would it be a continuum? So I guess if we are willing to say that animals have some kind of creativity, then maybe machines can have some kind of creativity that's not the same maybe as ours, but it's creative. We're getting confronted by meaning of life. Yeah.
Speaker A: Do we to maybe because I'm sure we could stay on this topic for literally ever. How do we feel about Pragmatically for the rest of the conversation? When we talk about creativity here, we're talking about kind of I'm sorry, I forget your name.
Speaker F: Lyn cole.
Speaker A: Lynn Cole. Like kind of Lynn Cole's original definition, which is the capacity to bring kind of new things to life or connect new ideas. That kind of thread. And when we talk about expression, we'll use that. We'll share that phrase to add on this additional component of reflecting some interiority of some kind. And I know that's still a bit vague, but does that feel like we're at the 80% of capturing of the 80 20 capturing definitions? If anyone has adding something new to.
Speaker F: The human conversation of perception of production versus like beaver world or tree world consciousness of the earth, but more so like human productivity adding to that next level, that's what we're narrowing it in on human creativity.
Speaker A: Oh, I didn't bring up human in any way. I'm just trying to separate the capacities for creation creativity and creation that reflects some kind of interiority, which I'm calling expression. And those can be valued differently. And we might think different things about how AI can relate to those, how we relate to AI for the purpose of creativity versus for the purpose of.
Speaker F: Expression, et cetera, in culture, I'm guessing, though, but right now we're talking about human culture is the only culture. I guess that's what I like to put in on human culture versus AI culture.
Speaker A: We're not narrowing there's no goal for where this conversation goes. Besides, I only have this goal to just have us have. So if you want to bring us into a conversation topic, which sounds like fun to me, of separating out how is AI going to interact with human culture right now, versus what is the next kind of culture that will be developed as a function of a more mature AI creative ecosystem? That sounds very interesting. Do you want to introduce that topic?
Speaker F: I guess just on that line of thinking, my thoughts are that there's going to be emerging culture that we can't even imagine yet as far as creative scientific developments that are going to happen and new forms of even art or production that we can't really imagine yet, but humans won't be able to replicate. So our value of human production and culture is going to kind of shift over the coming years and decades to maybe value these autonomous systems idea of making things new for us. I guess I'm trying to visualize it in my head. It's like a shift in culture.
Speaker D: We're the consumers, though. We're the ones that decide until AI takes over. Right now, we're the consumers.
Speaker A: Have most of us watched the movie her?
Speaker D: I got to watch that again.
Speaker A: I just started watching it again, and I didn't refinish my so there's this part in it, right? I mean, there's a lot of kind of grappling with this question, actually, as the subtext of the movie and one oh, yeah, go for it. Yeah, sorry. I have to make a decision between having this place kind of too hot or a little too loud. But there's this one point where one of the women, I forget her name, she shows this film she's made of her mother, and it's just her mom sleeping. And it's really, I think by today's standards, bad art. It's boring, it's not good. But within the context of this time, what she was, like, yearning to do and show is like, I made something, and I'm showing something. This is my interpretation away. I'm showing something human here. This is my mom. She's sleeping. This is real. And that's a relationship. And at that point, people, the people around her weren't like, oh, my God, this is amazing. They were a little confused by it. They were like, I'm not sure if this is what why are you showing me? But it was along this trajectory, I think you're talking about where people are figuring out how to grapple with a world where human creative output is not that relevant for the evolution of society in some way, evolution of science and technology.
Speaker B: At least I had a thing to kind of interested in going deep into because you brought up that point of tomorrow. If logo creation just becomes something that AI does, and whenever you need to create a logo, you don't ask an artist to do it. You just ask AI to do it. After that point becomes utilitarian of sorts. And then you brought up that point that it's just pixel then. So does that change the definition of what we perceive as art itself? Or is it just sounds like a.
Speaker A: Good time for Kyle to enter the ring. What do you mean?
Speaker D: Again? It's like, where do you want to jump? Mean, life is art. Life is creation. Creation art is creation. Inspiration is inhale. Breathe in life. You're breathing life into reality. So I look at it as the perceiver. I look at logo designed by fucking AI is amazing. It'll give me a logo with all thousands of years of history and the designing and color coding in. But I'm the one that accepts it. I'm the one this story I'm going to bring to the world. I'm the creator. I mean, it gives me all the it's material. It's like photoshop. It's a camera, it's paints. It's a canvas I create.
Speaker E: We don't even need AI for that, actually.
Speaker A: You don't need AI for the curation?
Speaker E: Well, no, like the logo creation. I mean, it's not exactly logo creation, but there's a thing that happens on Twitter which people might know about, is if you tweet t shirt idea and something along with it, there are Twitter bots that basically just mock that up for you. Why do we buy Ikea versus a local craftsman's work? So we already do have that inherent valuation based on how easy it is for something to be produced. So I think that analogy does work. And yes, we will continue to do that in other places as well. But then I guess the other interesting thing, and Diana might have more to say about this, but with memes, for example, there's almost an intentional downgrading of the quality of production as well, right? Like deep thread memes or other like you probably have better examples of those where producing something that is not perfect, that is not aesthetically pleasing or commercially valuable, is almost the point of the exercise.
Speaker A: And that's again, we see this at the commons, the community work. There are people who make scenes and the goal. I mean, it's kind of like the her film of a thing where it's like this is like maybe it's important that it's shitty. Probably not. I think it's more important that it's like mine more important than it's what mine. Hold on. Your name was called out to you.
Speaker C: Well, I have lots to say. I'll touch on the mean thing first, and then I'll touch on, I think, my Pragmatic point of view. Yes, memes. The whole point is they're really shitty. They made like if they're not pixelated in some degree is it really a meme. So earlier in the introductions, I was talking about how I've tried using Chat GBT and integrating it with my meme content. And one of the issues is the relevance or context that's missing. So it's like three degrees removed from being contextually accurate. And so that's interesting to me of like, what is that cornerstone of being able to nail it, right? Like, this is relevant to this very specific type of person. And I don't know if that can be automated. I would love to see that happen.
Speaker A: Do you think so? This one, I wrote this down when you were because my own assumption is that right now, GPT Four, for instance, its training data is 2021. Memes are of the moment they are culturally. So I assume, though, that there will be a point where we have daily, hourly, minutely updated AI systems. To me, the failures that you're seeing seem like the kind of failures that will be improved upon over time.
Speaker D: The whole mem thing is it's meant to meme. I mean, the viruses, it's replication, it's creation, what things are trying to replicate.
Speaker A: Well, but I thought what you were talking about, like, memes are not a piece of it's part of being part of a dialogue, like a conversation.
Speaker C: Well, I think there's also two aspects, right? There's like, the intellectual part of a meme and then there's the visual aspect of the meme. So, like, a visual aspect of a meme, I think, is easily replicated, but I think in terms of the context or when it's placed or however it shows up, I think that's when that you can't replicate or automate to a certain degree.
Speaker A: Way before GPT, there were like these this is a much simpler model, not even a transport, and it would create idioms. And they had very simple structure, but like, the mountain on the whatever, so too blah, blah, blah. And they were like, vague enough and evocative enough that when you listen to them, it felt like genuine insight. You're like, oh, deep, that's deep shit. And clearly the deepness, to the extent that it was there at all, didn't come from the system that created it. It came from you interpreting this vagary. It's like a horoscope. Right? Do you think memes I kind of feel like memes probably are like that too. You can put out things and within the context of that community, people will be like, that has meaning or not.
Speaker C: Yeah. Does that feel I agree to a certain extent, but I'm known for customized means, so I think that's probably why I'm hyper specific or neurotic about it.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker C: But yeah, for example, Peppy the Frog means something to millions of people, and all for different reasons as well. Right.
Speaker A: I see you're like, look, I'm small batch meme, maybe those basic memes.
Speaker C: But it's just the context is very different for me than probably, I don't know, a lot of people in middle America. Yeah, but is that going to be referenced in Chat GPT? Is that going to be like if you said, hey, what is Pepe the Frog in Chat GPT right now? What is the answer that's being delivered.
Speaker A: As an AI model, I cannot say anything about.
Speaker C: But kind of coming back to the overarching conversation, the way that I kind of see or like to boil down, this is the scale of conscious creation to tangible impact, which is kind of like the creativity conversation, right? But that's under the guise that everything is human made or made via whatever tools that may be. But if there's, like, AI consciousness or AI systems, right, then it not just becomes a scale. It becomes the X axis, and the Y axis is human versus AI. And then it becomes four different quadrants of what is considered acceptable and tangibly accurate, I guess, of what's important to society or what means something, right? Because if you think about tangible impact of an AI system, right, there was no conscious effort, or at least like human conscious effort, but it still created all these whatever that is possible in the future, is that acceptable? Is that worth more than a human doing it themselves in a library without computers? I could draw it out. I don't know. It makes sense in my head.
Speaker D: But what gets things worth? What gets things worth?
Speaker C: That's a great question.
Speaker A: Scarcity, I think, what you're talking about.
Speaker C: Worth as in well, tangible impact. But yes, again, that's objective as a.
Speaker D: Human experience, that's basically like a monetary quantity.
Speaker A: There's a difference.
Speaker C: Like, for example, I run a meme community. A lot of people are like, you're wasting your time. I'm like, okay, well, actually, it means a lot to a very specific type of person. Right? So does that make it not worth it? Does it make it not tangible? Right? But it's certainly human made. It is not automated by any degree, right? But if there were memes made by AI systems, will it have that same impact? Would people still care?
Speaker D: Well, maybe.
Speaker A: One thing, and I'm going to bring you into this conversation now, where the rubber hits the road is how much of this creative output at least in our current system, how much of this creative output is you versus the System? And how much do I if I created the System and I am therefore potential co creator of that, do I have a right to it? Creatively. Do I have a right to its monetary output? Can I shut it down? And these are fundamentally legal questions is why I wanted to bring you in here.
Speaker C: Yeah, I was going to say, like, how you were explaining it with the access. I really love that because it actually gives some structure around how you define creativity. But it's also very reminiscent of how the law defines copyright. For something to be protected by copyright, it needs to be human made. So even under US law, it explicitly says it cannot be machine made, it's not copyrightable, and there needs to be substantial effort.
Speaker D: That's a big question. What is that substantial?
Speaker C: And then what is that?
Speaker D: What is that exactly?
Speaker E: Fair use sort of hinges on that, right?
Speaker C: And then, yeah, of course there's like exceptions to this, but this is like the main premise that it needs to be made by a human. But I feel with what does made mean exactly?
Speaker A: As a lawyer, exactly in the past.
Speaker C: But now when I was looking deeper into this around five years ago, when I was looking into generative music, this was where I got caught up on because I was like, why does the law require it to be human when actually the output could be the same? Does that mean the law values puts a higher value on creativity generated by a human versus I mean, could you.
Speaker F: If a human put the prompt in that they made it or no?
Speaker A: Well, that's a wide word. And would that be substantial effort? Maybe if I showed a recording of me going like this for an hour and then I typed the prompt, then you'd be like, that was substantial effort. But if I just sat down on my computer and then just went like this, then maybe that's not I don't know if these are the ambiguities that.
Speaker D: So are you working on the legalities of this?
Speaker C: Yeah, so I work with startups as a lawyer.
Speaker D: Oh, nice.
Speaker C: So it comes up quite a lot with the transformative quality. For example, if you're training an LLM, if you're putting in copyrighted data and what's coming out is what you've actually then is the output. Is that something that you can then claim have copyright over even though it's from copyrighted material and under the law it's transformative. So in theory, yes, you can then protect that because you've created something new from it.
Speaker E: It's like a photocopy of a paper, a new paper.
Speaker A: Thank you.
Speaker D: Derivation? Princeton. How much? How do you quantify that exactly?
Speaker C: But I think even the legislators, they haven't considered how things are changing over time, like how big of a step that technology is taking.
Speaker D: I'm just question about the prompts. I imagine right now, my understanding is no, prompt is not copyrighted. You got to put it in photoshop. You have to take your image and put in Photoshop and make some shape.
Speaker A: No, it will take the output the current state.
Speaker C: Yeah, the output that is copyrightable, depending on how it was created.
Speaker D: It's also stupid. Okay, sorry. When online creating first happened, you couldn't had me typewriter. What the guy did is he made a typewriter, he made a computer that typed and that was acceptable. So right now I could set up a computer that took my excuse my French, whatever, I'm not going to say took my image from mid journey, put it in Photoshop, automated it, changed it. And then I'm like, I didn't do any of it. But it's legality. Legalized fans. I don't have to tell Court that I do anything. But I went to photoshop. I mean, it's stupid. Sorry.
Speaker C: No, it's like the law will always be behind. But this is something that I was thinking about, like how there is definitely.
Speaker D: Going to be cases that come up quite my right.
Speaker C: Well, I kind of want to come back to AI systems against humans. And I firmly believe we always create existing systems. But why is the digital system much more threatening and talked about? To be fair, it's much more advanced and not the same as the US.
Speaker E: Government.
Speaker D: But every innovation goes through backlash. I mean, like when the digital came out, I mean, it was seriously put out. Illustrators, like lots of illustrators have lost their jobs. But those same people right now are like, you can't do AI. But certainly their jobs. So they're used to doing digital art. Now it's going to be kicked out to anybody can do right. I think this thing about copyright is quite interesting, actually. And this idea of like, who made this? I made this very confident historically. Copyright is very confident, historically specific. If you look at Walt Disney, who took all of these fairy tales for generations and generations, no one worried about who thought of these, whose stories were these? These are just when he comes out of money, right? And then he comes in and he takes it and it kind of freezes it in copyright. Now I own this even though I'm based on generations. What's interesting on the legal stuff, I imagine you follow because I mean, people I follow, it's like all about money. Look at what Disney's going to do.
Speaker C: Follow.
Speaker D: They're going to break path. As long as you're in the wave behind them, you'll be fine. But I was thinking about this thing about creativity. How much of it is like systems? What is the system, the largest system? Am I part of a historical system with people who came before me and ideas that are floating around that I kind of take and I mash together and I make something new and stuff like that? That's life. Yeah.
Speaker A: Maybe something like let me be an uber copyright optimist here. Which is like the benefit of we want to set up a system where we incentivize creation. We want people to make new things. And there's an assumption that some protection or that you will benefit from your creation is good for innovation. And then like many things, there's regulatory capture. Disney being the prime example of this, where it's probably not helping the Snow White story meet. Like maybe some of you have seen like Winnie the Pooh as recently enters the public domain and someone's making like a Winnie the Pooh horror movie. They're exploring new kinds of ways of interacting with these. Old, but maybe that's a different perspective we can take. Here we are interacting in a particular system. There are constraints on how do we move copyright in this next step, but what do we think is actually beneficial will actually benefit, let's say, sentient beings, humans, whatever. What kind of system of responsibility and payment and whatever do we think will best allow us to create the things art, science, engineering, whatever that benefit us. You're king of the world. What components allow these human AI collaborations to best support us moving forward?
Speaker F: I think as long as it's human led, it's still going to be a question of money and access to better systems. I don't know if we can talk about after it's not a human conversation anymore, but it's monetary value, how much money you have and how much you can assign to what you're producing by these advanced systems that only you can access now. So it's like a money thing.
Speaker A: But the uber libertarian free market people would say that the money thing is the incentive structure to allow this whole system to actually create beneficial things. Yeah, each individual cares about money. That's kind of the coordination device. But the overall system, what it cares about, the dynamics of the whole thing is like making things that are beneficial to humans. I'm not trying to endorse this argument, but this is like a gloss of the free market kind of evangelism the.
Speaker F: Current system, or is that what we're envisioning will become the system?
Speaker A: I mean, I think some people who are like free market, like I said, evangelists would say already it's our best system to bring to life beneficial things for humans using the mechanism of the market.
Speaker F: Because I think that's very utopian, because if that was possible, would already be happening now.
Speaker A: They would say it is, it just takes time.
Speaker F: But it's more driven by money now and has always been for the last couple of thousand years. So I don't think that's overarchingly going to become utopian optimistic view of let's just make things better for people.
Speaker A: Sorry. I think, just to clarify what this point? Money is the abstraction of the thing that makes people like that people value. It's not that people are like money driven. Money is the thing that and the driver of production.
Speaker D: Right.
Speaker A: Is that yeah, the coordination not to make things new.
Speaker F: Because if that's the case, we would be like the Jetsons 50 years ago. We could have had the possibilities to have so much technology that's been suppressed, but it's not to make things better has not ever been the idea, in my opinion. It's just been the overarching thing is money. And that's what drives even innovation and production, is just having access to money to drive that conversation. I don't know if it's ever been make things better for people, make things new for people. Because if that was the case, we would be in a lot different culture and world right now. Are you saying what is the overarching driver of.
Speaker A: Well, one response to that is to say, like, okay, what additional structure do you need beyond the free market, which in our current world, you would think about regulations or standards that people set, or, like, cultural soft law. You're also proposing a more radical kind of future where you can imagine AI systems who are unmoored from the drivers that humans are driven to. And maybe that could be a way to promote creative expression. Anyway, I still would like to hear from others on this broader question on what do you think would help humanity benefit from human creative? I'm sure some artists might say make AI illegal.
Speaker D: How to have humanity.
Speaker A: We want to be able to create things that help humans, right? Or, like, sentient help humans.
Speaker D: Can you state the question?
Speaker A: One way to think about what is the goal of any of the requirements we put, the laws that we put, like, our culture one gloss of a goal for society is to advance human or sentient flourishing. That's, like, an idea, right? Like, we would like to set things up such that replication of life a.
Speaker D: Goal is Replicating life.
Speaker A: Well, let me talk about, like, the FDA.
Speaker D: What I'm trying to do is take what you're saying I'm just like, sympathizing what you're saying. I'm trying to repeat back.
Speaker A: Well, I don't think Replicating life does.
Speaker D: That's a word, but that might not be the best word. But you said you use a much, many more words.
Speaker A: I use human flourishing.
Speaker D: Flourishing. Yeah.
Speaker A: I used flourishing specifically instead, so I.
Speaker D: Turned that into replication.
Speaker A: Yeah. Which seems like as representing what you're trying to say.
Speaker D: I mean, it's not as poetic or beautiful, but I'm just trying to understand.
Speaker A: Sure. Let's say that the objective is replication of life. Then what would be the things we would want from our creative marketplace that best helped us replicate life?
Speaker F: I want to hear from other people first, but I finally came up with something, I guess, too cool.
Speaker A: Do other people want to weigh in on this?
Speaker B: Like, on your original question of how is it what's the way to go about it? I think one way of looking at it is just, like, giving you more time to focus on the things that you're actually good at and put more undervalued, in his case, when you were talking about doing a PhD. And part of it is researching. Part of it is writing your papers and using AI to edit. So you get more time that way to focus on your ideas. You're still the creator of those ideas and things like that. And it's a much more seamless process to putting it out in the world where you don't have to write each and every word, but you're saving time on that and then can focus more.
Speaker D: Yeah, I'm saving time, but I also sometimes I reflect on is the struggle valuable in and of itself? It's like learning to do something the hard way might be like just have done it. Not that I want to do that every time, but having actually learned to write by myself and struggle, but then you can kind of say that about anything. Like to drive a car, I should ride a horse first, or whatever, or a horse encourage or whatever. But sometimes it is valuable to have kind of learned to do something the hard way before you kind of start automating it. Just so you know, how does this thing actually work? I completely agree. But what I'm seeing society say is judging people like, this isn't art because you didn't go through it well, that's the pain. The pain is my personal pleasure. That's my experience. It's none of your business. You're judging me for creating this without going through that. But this actually that is just a personal experience. You should stay out of that. Let's just talk about this. But human flourishing, though, what is human flourishing? How do humans flourish?
Speaker A: I'm taking let's be utilitarian kind of, which is there's something in each of our heads that was going to be hard to define then I don't really want to spend a lot of time defining it, of moving society forward in some kind of way. And astra you brought up, this one possibility is like, we all have things we're good at and things we're bad at. And one way that AI human collaboration can support us is allowing most of us to spend even more of our time in our students of genius or whatever. Right. We can not be distracted by that. And I'm sure most of us, when we've used Chat GPT, already have experienced this. Everyone has the blank page problem. And Chat GPT really helps you get through the blank page problem whenever you hit. Just like you just always have this. People talk about software engineers having their rubber ducky to bounce ideas off of. The thing we have to bounce ideas off of now is insane. It doesn't just hear us, it collaborates back and forth. Maybe it also projects us into a narrowed view of creative expression, though. Maybe through that bouncing, we don't bounce everywhere. We bounce into the attractor space of chachi, DT's creative output. Maybe that's not a great thing. Maybe we would be better with a rubber ducky. I don't know. But I do think that your point here is one of the optimistic ways.
Speaker D: Of allowing people to actually it's like an igniter. It ignites our creativity or helps us brainstorm or puts a structure on.
Speaker A: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Astra had brought up the idea that even more, I think, powerfully. Let's say I'm really good at the ideas. Everyone I've heard many times it's the age of the ideas guy right now. Because if you have an idea but you're not good at writing marketing copy. I don't have to give a shit about that anymore. I just be like, Go write marketing copy.
Speaker D: I've been thinking about this because obviously I hang out a lot with people who are like, software engineers, developers, and I'm like, oh, GPT can write code now. Right. So you don't actually need to learn Python or you don't really need to go through even if you didn't do so well in your programming classes, it'd be okay. But actually, I think to fully appreciate what GPT can do, you need to be a good programmer yourself. I think that's what I'm getting. Because what I was saying about, for example, writing, when you write, what I've noticed is so I don't program, but I do write, so I can't appreciate how GPT improves the programming process, because I'm just like, wow, give me code. It works, it executes. But in writing, I definitely sense, oh, actually, this is probably not a good this is not deep. I got to tell GPT, this is not insightful. I'm disappointed in you, but this is a good kind of addition in terms of insight. And I like how you combine, like, combining these two elements with two literary techniques. That's interesting, but combining that, that's pretty elementary, right? So I do feel like it helps us learn and be smarter, but I don't think we should be vacating our thought process, our creative, or our productive process either. Right. So I know what you're saying about, oh, we're all going to become ideal ideas people, but I think maybe we all need to also be realistic that for us to really thrive, we also still have to know what well, didn't.
Speaker A: Akhil bring this up at the beginning as, like, the one fundamental aspect of creativity is taste. And I think that's kind of what.
Speaker D: You'Re taste, as in, like, you have to good taste in things. Is that what you mean? Yeah. That's beautiful.
Speaker A: This is what I hear also when I've heard this talk about when you become a principal investigator in science, what is your experience? What value do you add in a scientific thing? Because sometimes it seems like you sit around, you get grants. Sure. But you just kind of talk to people. The main thing that Pi's principal investigators hopefully develop is scientific taste. Right. They can quickly grasp this is an interesting direction. This is not an interesting direction. And that happens at all scales, and you're talking about it at the scale of, like, these are interesting.
Speaker D: What that is that's intuition.
Speaker A: Totally.
Speaker D: And that comes I think intuition comes from experience. So on state, this is what I want to say, like, five minutes ago, before we started all this, but with imaging, what we're seeing now, an artist before AI came along, back when you're drawing, you spent a lifetime, maybe on a style or two. I mean, possibly five. Now with AI, I can go through fucking I can go I can spend a day on fucking one style and be, I've done it. I'm going to do this. There's going to be as much exploration of art in this year than there was in last consistent fan. So this is how you get intuition. You do it. I mean, I make 50 fucking thousand images. You do it, you do it, you do it. You get intuition. Yeah, no, I totally agree with that.
Speaker C: Same thing.
Speaker D: Like, Ilia sits cover. He's the only one that I think has an intuitive feel for GBT. So to answer your question, how is this advancing mankind? Well, I think what he was saying here, it helps you learn stuff so much faster. Right. Whereas before, I would never have ventured into the art world or these techniques or this craft, but now I'm like, oh, I can learn it very quickly. Same thing. For example, I've been learning a lot of machine learning and quantum mechanics and all that stuff, just because people are talking about that. With GPT, it's a lot faster to learn about these things. Yeah. And I can ask it questions at a deeper level than most experts because most experts, I mean, they're tired and they're not understanding your question correctly, and they got a conversation. Yeah. You can't sometimes with GPT, it actually understands where my gap was two questions ago, and then in my follow up question, it'll address that gap from earlier and it's just yeah, so I think that's quite so whether it's creativity, it's knowledge. You build the intuition from knowledge, the experience. Yeah. I think. Has anybody gone, like, read Finnegan's wake with chat TV. Like, I would never fucking read on my own, but now spinning his wake are novel.
Speaker E: Yeah, well, that's an interesting point, right? Because he's invented words literally, right, that are not in the English language.
Speaker D: I'm not just going to read it.
Speaker E: That's the other thing, right? Let's put that Rick Rubin comment into context. Rick Rubin does not play any music instrument. And his entire point is he's good at what he does, which is producing music, because he knows what good music sounds like. So what he's saying is, okay, I understand what good music sounds like as taste, but taste is inherently about the mainstream. Or like, it's about I'm not disagreeing.
Speaker D: With everybody with Pariah. Yeah.
Speaker E: But I think to a counterpoint and perhaps a negative one with this explosion with Chat, GPT is a homogenization of taste itself.
Speaker D: That's why I said it's. What I encounter with we're going to go through as much art evolution this year as we did in the last thousand years. Yes, it's going to homogenize. But out of that homogenation, the artists will be fucking crazy. They're going to go nuts. Some people are worried about homogenation. It's not going to be a problem.
Speaker E: I think my point is that we need to be conscious about don't need.
Speaker D: To be conscious about anything. Just go fucking explore. Go make art. Don't need to be conscious. Have an experience, share your experience. I'm saying, I'm sorry about this. I heard somebody down on one of these podcasts, and he spent fucking half of it saying, I want to be an artist. I'm like, just be an artist. I don't want to hear that. Just show me what you're creating. I want to see what you create. I'd love to see what you create. I don't want to hear about talking about it.
Speaker A: First of all, I want to just recognize that as just a meta point. So my question before was, what structures do you think we should put into place to allow us to best flourish? And the way if I put that into a governance, into a conversation with a bunch of governance people next week we'll be talking about guardrails people, would be like, well, you need to have these policies. These policies. What this conversation became was a complete ignoring of that question completely. And just talk about how much AI is already potentially supporting or not supporting. And that's a different question. We don't have to dive.
Speaker F: I wanted to tie because I think you could piggyback on no matter how much people are producing more, they think they're doing better. Production of art or intuition or perception of everyone contributing more, and that might make things better for people. That's not the question to piggyback on that. I think democratizing acknowledgment of that thought is the answer to a regulation of how do you move the ball forward. Because then no matter how much or less people are producing individually, an AI system to recognize everyone individually, their thoughts and accomplishments could then democratize moving forward collectively of everyone versus one person that stands out that shouldn't because they have more money or not. If you democratize the acknowledgment of everyone's thoughts, that's going to take to a degree, a bit of privacy away or freedom, but it would also move the ball forward outside of a monetary system.
Speaker A: I'm going to try and restate this and let me know if I'm the same. So any creative accomplishment van Gogh the creation of SpaceX, whatever was built upon a billion innovations by a billion people. And we do not have the system to properly thank and give credit to those billion people both through the money we give them and their recognition or anything. Instead, we have to simplify, this is the great man.
Speaker D: What is recognition?
Speaker A: Well, how do we think about them? How are they compensated? How are they brought up?
Speaker D: What are they given, though? What's their experience being recognized?
Speaker A: Let me just finish. I think just resay this. Tell me if I'm honest, and then we can dive. Because I think this is an interesting direction for conversation. We'll have some time to go through it. So there are a whole bunch of reasons why we haven't been able to do that. Up until now, they're mostly practical, right? It's kind of difficult to bring together who was responsible for the idea of democracy or whatever.
Speaker D: Does it matter if you can give them what they want? That's what recognition is the core of the question.
Speaker A: Just to finish the actual idea. One possibility now is that in the generation of, let's just say, a specific example of a new piece of art, we actually know or can potentially inform this creation and try to understand its providence in terms of the data that informed it. The people that created that data, the person that prompted the thing, maybe they're more responsible for that particular piece of artwork, but it's actually a societal invention. Each piece of art, everything is a societal thing. Everything is and a kind of utopian step forward is for us as society to be able to recognize that in terms of there benefit people who contribute a more interesting thing that isn't exactly the thing, but the next thing is the thing that everyone buys. Maybe that person should get some credit. It seems kind of Web Three ish acknowledgment and coordination.
Speaker D: Totally identify with what you said. As I hang out more with entrepreneurs since I've gotten to the Web Three crowd and also just spent a bit of time in Asia and Hong Kong and mainland China, and I mean China just over the past few decades have developed at this breakneck pace. And you only see the success stories now. You only see the Big Ten cent Huawei Alibaba who've done really well, but you actually don't see the human toll that this level of breakneck pace of development has actually created. And I think the people who have suffered or I don't know if suffered is the right word, but kind of like what Ian was saying, it is a collective effort that created what we see now. There's so many entrepreneurs who lost their shirts and who have they had this incredible idea, but they were the number two rental bike, whatever company, and then that meant nothing. That meant bankrupt.
Speaker A: I mean, in science, there are so many people who publish things that are essentially not recognized and someone eventually puts the pieces together in a way that is transformative. And there are certain people that see this is called power law distribution of citations. And they're like certain people are way more impactful than other people. They're way more important. That might be the case. It might be some people are way more important. And most of us are just like grunts that support the system that these rare five people maybe. But another possibility is that you're not just standing up on the shoulders of giants, you're standing on the shoulders of this mass of people that hold up. I see you wanting to say no.
Speaker D: I wanted to introduce I remember the term that I read about, like it's in science and technology studies stuff where it's how is science, how is knowledge produced and all that. It's basically what you're saying now. It's like a bunch of people and then this one guy kind of rises to the top and becomes like the symbol for that.
Speaker A: The representative.
Speaker D: Representative was this term that this one German scientist or something like that introduced that was like denkgemenchaft or like a thought fellowship or something like that. One laboratory is like a thought fellowship or one department or one university or like the community of universities around the world. It's all part of like a thought fellowship or what. So it's all part kind of recognizing that, yeah, you're standing on the shoulders of not only giants but also everyone around you, all your colleagues. It's a fellowship.
Speaker A: I've decided to allow the era and the culture of DeLorean.
Speaker D: But I just wanted to introduce that term. Do it in what you want.
Speaker A: Like thought fellowship.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker A: And I love the idea of the because the world is a thought. The world is so maybe one of the structures I've never been positive about anything Web Three, but one of the things that does seem worthwhile is to allow and maybe can separate us from our selfish needs to not just create but also get recognition for the creation. Right. There's a conflict right now with like, yeah, I want to make that, but I also want to make sure that I get the credit for it. And if I could just trust that I would get the credit that the AI system that makes the stuff, like, if it's using my music or whatever, would filter down to me having a life or whatever, I could become freer in being created.
Speaker D: It's all like blockchain technology. Totally. You're almost like speaking to the as if you're part of the gospel. Yeah, no, I mean, it's true. That is what kind of the genesis at least that's how I got into crypto or Web Three. This idea of decentralized ownership of people being paid for. That's what NFTs are. Right. You can track the royalties and commission. You can continue to digitally because there's a footprint and then it's like verified and no middleman or music producer can siphon these funds. That's the idea. But I think it's a separate argument. I mean, whether it's Web Three will achieve that, whether it's Blockchain will achieve that. But clearly I do agree with you that the way we're being like success is being rewarded now probably is not the fairest.
Speaker A: And it seems kind of important given that one conversation that we haven't had right now, which I think is fine, is what's going to happen to the jobs of creative people. Like this real thing where some people respond, I think blithely to that, where they're like, creative disruption always happens. There will be new creative people and they're like, basically dismiss this concern. But there's a possibility that while there are still creatives in the future, the current group of creatives who allowed this next step to happen are not part of benefiting from that next stage because maybe they're actually not useful anymore for their commercial purposes. You don't need logo designers anymore because logo design has been commodified. But wouldn't it be nice if those previous logo designers could be recognized for their contribution into that? This has been a long standing debate, not just in Creative, but if you're the laborers at Google and work there for a while before they figured out how to automate your current but I.
Speaker D: Guess the argument is you get paid while you're there. Yeah, right.
Speaker A: Totally.
Speaker D: The very capitalistic view of things is you get paid marginally for the utility that you bring in for the next minute or the next hour.
Speaker A: I think the response there is clearly there was some amount that could have been paid to you for your labor that was instead of reserved for R and D efforts to put into the ability to automate you. I don't know.
Speaker D: It'll be a very complex incentive.
Speaker A: No, I'm not yet, but yeah, I'm just trying to say there is this general point about trying to both, like Web Three or whatever, future allow recognition and AI systems and our failures of copyright and other things potentially requiring us to invent these new recognition.
Speaker D: Yeah. The really thing about recognition as an artist, what I want, I want to be able to give them. I want people to know what I can create. I want to play with people I can create. I don't really care about them. I mean, the money's in it. I don't really care. You copy it all you want.
Speaker F: I just want to play more.
Speaker D: That's all. I want recognition, and people want to.
Speaker F: Be acknowledged for that.
Speaker D: I don't give a crap about acknowledgement. I want to create more other people.
Speaker A: Minimum, they need to be able to put food on the table.
Speaker D: Yeah, as I said, jokingly. UBI. And what is the end game? The end game? This is interesting. Once AI is doing everything we need, what are we going to do? Play and create. And then that's what is art. It's playing, it's fun, it's creation.
Speaker E: But there's inherently something about life itself, right? Like a drive for existence that is beyond just money.
Speaker D: Yeah, money is only good money. Like you said earlier, it's like a metaphor. It's like a representation of our desire.
Speaker A: So in a very early AI salon, one of the questions that came up, or one of the ideas was, let's say we're in this future where AI systems can do literally everything we need, right? They advance health, they advance and in some ways, there's the possibility of a dearth of meaning for a lot of people.
Speaker D: Yes.
Speaker A: Maybe artists who are like, I'm just going to play, and that's like, where I get meaning from, it works. But for some other people, where meaning came from really improving the reality of humanity. I wanted to push forward, help. Those people are suddenly without any source of meaning. And anyway within that conversation one idea came up which is really humans in general are playing status games and status games are going to exist independent of anything else. And so maybe most of us will have actually will feel totally fine just like Aristocrats in the 16 hundreds felt fine because all of our material needs are dealt with but we're still playing status games. So another response to you about what does that recognition give you is if I was creating things that became a fundamental component of how most AI systems were creating music, let's say I want that status. I want you to know that all this might change.
Speaker D: I can't think of my point of view. I've done things like that. I don't really care whether people know it or not. I want to play, I want to keep creating. And the reason why you're at a.
Speaker A: Stage of status already within where you.
Speaker D: I always wanted this. Like 30 years ago I wanted this anyway. The stuff I did I knew I could do before I did it. I need people to let me in. And you know where that came from? It came from friendships, came from connections, not from public status. But don't you think like this need for recognition it might be culturally constructed in this historic moment. People in the future might not have the same need. Maybe.
Speaker A: And I think Kyle's talking about a potentially really lovely future where people actually don't feel the need.
Speaker D: And death but they're still bringing more meaning to people's lives through art.
Speaker A: Yeah totally.
Speaker D: And it could be science.
Speaker F: Like how can we I mean look.
Speaker D: Fucking brain chemicals, fucking nuts. Like we're going to have psychedelics so those scientists there's going to be plenty of room for scientists to improve humanity without saving their lives for sure. Just a slightly skeptical on this concept if I'm understanding it correctly because at the end of the day I mean.
Speaker A: Kill you heading.
Speaker D: Care. Take care okay I'm actually on a camp out of school yesterday but okay.
Speaker A: So let me just say a few things before people head out. So hopefully you've seen that there's now the AI salon calendar. You can subscribe there if you found us through Cerebral Valley. Most of our events end up on Cerebral Valley anyway so you can see them there. The events generally these kinds of events have been getting like 50 to 100 people signing up. So we really do want repeat visitors and we'll try to preference people who have come back to some degree but just know that you just might not be able to come to every single event because there is a lot of interest but really value coming here today. We have every six or so weeks I think we're trying to do larger events where more people can come. They. Won't be quite as intimate, but especially if you've already been to one, you can end up really, I think, helping those if you decide to come and if you have any other ideas or in the future want to host your own or anything like that, please let us know or talk to us. We're happy to talk to you about what we think. We think about throwing Spence and everything else. But anyway, akil, Kyle, thank you so much for coming.
Speaker D: Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you.
Speaker A: We have a space for like, 2025. People can feel comfortably in an office. That would be awesome because I think in the future we would love to have more. Like, I think we could host when Andrew, my co host, and myself are there. We can host two of these at once with 20 ish people. And that would be great. And then I'm also working on this is, like, under wraps, but maybe there'll be an official partnership with Outside Lens for a huge music hackathon.
Speaker D: I'm working on it.
Speaker A: I bought a domain outside of LLX.
Speaker D: Music how do you say?
Speaker F: Music hackathon?
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker A: I'm just making new tools.
Speaker F: AI music.
Speaker A: I really want to see, like, mid journey for music.
Speaker D: That would be so mean.
Speaker A: I've been thinking about this for like, two years at this point. I think we're, like, close.
Speaker F: I know. The enterprises are really close, too. You're competing with people with dumb billions at the same problem.
Speaker D: The journey is 35 people.
Speaker A: Friendships are better than enterprise.
Speaker D: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker C: What's the outside land?
Speaker D: What's your website?
Speaker A: Thanks for hanging out for more time than I think.
Speaker C: Yeah, I'd love to stay connected.
Speaker B: I don't know how.
Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Can I have people if you're on Twitter, write down on my little notebook here. Just your Twitter handle, and I will tag you in the post following up here.
Speaker C: It's my card.
Speaker A: Oh, my God.
Speaker D: It even Steven.
Speaker C: Wait. Wow. It's my Tarot card. My textbook tarot card.
Speaker A: Love it.
Speaker C: So if Chachi BT can do that, I'd be rare.
Speaker A: Love it. Thank you.
Speaker D: Did you say Tarot cards?
Speaker C: Yeah. I don't want to how many do you have? Sorry, some of them are thank you. Not the correct one for the person for now. Yes, I'm working.
Speaker D: That's nice.
Speaker C: Thank you.
Speaker A: I don't think I'm not the fool, but I was given the fool, so I'll have to think about it for a bit. Maybe I'll interpret as the gesture. Shakespearean.
Speaker C: Creativity. Let us head out right now. Sorry, I need to go. Thank you. It's nice to meet you, too. Thank you.
Speaker D: See you, Kyle.
Speaker A: Nice to kill. All right, take care. Hello, Hanu. Did you have a good, good. I'm glad no one here was too allergic to cats. I don't know.
Speaker C: This has been really interesting to me because I wrote this essay around five years ago on this topic and a lot of the topics that have come up today in the discussion is actually how the essay went. But I haven't read it back and I want to go and read it again because also this concept around copyright and actual recognition, that was the conclusion I came to. I was just kind of trying to grapple with, why do we even have this structure? Who is it there to serve? And it was around the time, like, Ed Sheeran was also like, Just take my music. I don't oh, the music where he.
Speaker D: Was his lawsuit, right? Yeah, which he won eventually.
Speaker C: In the past, he was very open. He was like, oh, it's music. I want you to have it. I don't mind about the rights. The fact that you're listening to it is my recognition.
Speaker D: This is your point. Everything is built on everything else, right? Everything's built on other ideas. I study anthropologies. I kind of always bring this thing about everything being culturally and historically very specific, and this idea of copyright as well, because anthropologists have studied societies where they don't really have this idea of ownership that Westerners tend to. Have where it's more like things like if you go out hunting something and you come back to your village, then it's like just expected that that's shared. And you do not take any special cut or anything like that. It's just like.
Speaker A: My understanding is, at one point, in some cultures, the best hunter would sometimes be insulted and when they would get smaller, because it was very important for no individual to kind of feel way higher than the rest of society.
Speaker D: So it's like these are like small societies, but it's like just like it's sometimes helpful to think that things can be radically different than how we already live, right? How we already imagined the world to be. Even though it might not be radically different, because we have these very pat.
Speaker F: On the back for bringing home the meat. They're getting acknowledged. Maybe not, like, over the next no one cares after the meal. But in that moment, I'm just curious of a society where it actually is different, where acknowledgment of anything you does not matter. I don't know of any societies like.
Speaker D: No, I don't think the because I think there is some kind of acknowledgment.
Speaker A: Anyways, at minimum, if you bring back the meat many times over, I'm sure.
Speaker F: Send him.
Speaker A: They're like, this person is he is clearly our best.
Speaker B: There's also a certain amount of privilege involved when you are considering the discussion of recognition, because Ed, Shereen will be like, okay, take my music, because he can afford it. Yeah, he's popular and he has the money, but that's the only means for their living. Recognition is important to them. Creation is important.
Speaker A: But also, this is why I tried to say to Kyle a little bit, which is I don't mean this to be a humble brag, but I've gone to kind of elite institutions and throughout my life, I have not felt a need to prove myself. I had an inherent self confidence. And that self confidence might have existed regardless of these. Or it might be that because I had early badges of your good, I had the luxury of not worrying about recognition. And I think it's quite important to I mean, you know, even from not a status game. There's this book called Advice to a Young Investigator. There are a lot of books like this, but this was like written in the 18 hundreds, advice to a Young Investigator. And one question early on was like, how do I know if I can be a good scientist? Like, how do you answer that question? And the way the guy answered was like, well, first, here's a good way to go about it. Read all the literature in your field, which of course was possible back then, and then try up until last year and then come up with ideas about what is not known and then see if real scientists today are trying to do that or try to replicate some of the work that's done. And so my point of bringing up that anecdote is just saying another aspect of why recognition is valuable is to give you some feedback on whether it's worthwhile to continue to pursue this thing. We are not so perfect in our understanding of ourselves. And it might be helpful for me to know that. I draw and I play guitar, but when I like figure drawing a lot, but when I've drawn trees and shown those trees to people, they like those trees a lot more than my figure drawing. Now, does that mean I should give up on figure drawing? I don't know. But it's signal, it is true signal in the world that maybe I should pursue this tree thing more. And so I think recognition isn't just a status game. It's also signal about what feedback that.
Speaker D: You'Re doing on the right path. Is that what you mean?
Speaker C: Absolutely.
Speaker D: Yeah. I definitely feel like and I think earlier I was saying little skeptical. I think it's great. A gentleman over here was saying that he just goes out and produces stuff and I think that's awesome. And that is how we should be inspired and driven. But a lot of times in society you notice whether it's in the Web Three community or in the AI community, we're going to form these layers and tiers, right? And there is a drive to certainly attain a certain level of whether it's financial or other kind of kind of benefits. And that is what drives people. Like, at the end of the day, I'll be honest, I think it's what drive 90% of people out there and then maybe 10% of people do it because they just love the work.
Speaker C: No, I agree.
Speaker E: Yeah, I was going to say but even that I think, is sort of tied to your sense of identity, right? Like, the status games thing reminded me of this thing that's going on right now where Elon Musk challenged Zuckerberg to a wrestling match or something. And it is basically some expression of that, which is like, okay, when you have so much money, what do you end up doing?
Speaker A: I'll be honest, I did not while I was listening to a podcast about that cage fight earlier today, I did not think it would come up in.
Speaker D: Awesome. That's awesome. Yeah. We're saying that's a status thing. Is that what you're saying?
Speaker E: I think it's also maybe more deeper in the sense that status is also about identity, right? Like, in how you want to be.
Speaker A: Like, for these two people, elon Musk and Zuckerberg, who are living in a post scarcity world, right? They at least are, right? They have conquered the like, what makes them go. And it seems, especially for Zuckerberg, he needs new challenges to overcome. And so his are physical challenges for Musk. I don't know. He's just fucking trolling. I don't know. But yeah, totally. Yeah, that's one way to think about it.
Speaker D: I had a thought when you mentioned that you've gone to elite institutions and you made the point that you don't necessarily felt that you needed recognition or something like that.
Speaker A: I've never doubted my worth.
Speaker D: You've never doubted your worth. That's very interesting because then we can take class into the picture. So there's this lightness of being that comes with having privilege, in a sense.
Speaker A: Yeah, it said the same about identities, right? Like, white men not feeling like they identify as I don't identify as a man or white. It's like I'm just a person.
Speaker D: I'm just a person. Because you have the privilege to just be a person, but then you have people who have kind of, like, struggled their way up, then I think you really want that recognition because it's easier.
Speaker F: But it's not inherent of class. I think as someone that struggled and still struggling with a startup, to have that value is not I think it's inherent. It's not something that class. It's easier to be born into it and feel that way, but it's not real, maybe.
Speaker A: Totally. I wasn't trying to make a cartoon of my own sense of self worth. There are definitely other people who have had the same upbringing that I have and gone to elite institutions and doubt themselves. And so I'm not trying to say it's sufficient. I'm just trying to point out kind of like what you were bringing up, that it makes it easier. It makes it easier to pretend like it might not be that important when.
Speaker D: You'Ve already got validation.
Speaker A: I have those validations I had them.
Speaker F: From and that's regardless of class, those validations can come, I guess, is what I'm saying.
Speaker D: Yeah, sure.
Speaker A: Social life is very complicated. I'm just bringing out one. You're bringing out another feature of this?
Speaker D: No, please. No. Just because I thought it's a very common thing that you see in academics, for example, coming from lower socioeconomic classes, is that they're very hard work. They want that recognition that I put in the work. I wasn't born into this. At our firm previously, we love to hire people who have PhDs instead of philosophy. Doctor of Philosophy stands for poor, hungry and driven. I don't know. There's a certain when you have comfort, it doesn't quite resonate as much like the hard work and what it takes.
Speaker B: To go through your point is, like, the pain of okay, like you was mentioning, like the pain of writing. And it's making the process more.
Speaker A: As maybe a counter to Kyle's. So Kyle was bringing forward a utopian vision where people driven by the love of creation william, you brought up, like I'm actually not sure how many people are actually driven by the love of creation. Maybe 90%. I'll bring up another challenge to it, which is I'm not sure except in truly the world, where we do not need any coordination amongst people if it would even be desirable. Because one of the things that's helpful about people being pushed by status or money or whatever else some currency is that we as like a national government, a global government, a larger community can have some control over moving as one humanity organism rather than a bunch of individuals. We can have group goals. And that coordination comes from status or money or whatever, a bunch of other things. And so it's very helpful. Like, think about climate change. Like, a lot of us in San Francisco probably believe in carbon taxes. Why are carbon taxes even possible? Because people have incentives that are driven by the system and that allows us to have access to this thing. Carbon taxes. If we all were just driven by ourselves, we would have to lead a public advocacy campaign where we just make people like you should care. You should care a lot. And it's probably easier to coordinate by saying, actually, if you want to be high status or buy your mansion, whatever, you should care. So maybe there's a reason to actually maintain some status, some currency.
Speaker D: But yeah, some currency, some value.
Speaker A: Some value. Something that could be anything.
Speaker D: Yeah, totally. It doesn't have to be money. Totally.
Speaker A: That's what I just mean anything that people generally recognize that is fungible. I mean, I think that's what money is.
Speaker D: But it could be like you have different systems in our society. We have an economic system, a class system, I guess people with money. What I'm trying to get that there is in the Indian caste system, though, there's a different value. There's, like a spiritual value that makes certain individuals more worth than and I'm totally not in that society. I don't want to step in.
Speaker A: Well, you took a dangerous step.
Speaker D: Okay, finish your thought. But anyway, there is some other value other than money that makes you have status. In that society sure.
Speaker A: From my perspective, potentially serves a worse coordination value, because it's not I'm going to close this. Actually, though, I would love to spend just like do a once round and you can spend a minute if you want to gather your thoughts. I would just love to hear what is a thought that you resonated with during this discussion? Maybe it's a thought that came up in your mind that you haven't had a chance to share anything like that. Just like takeaways I would love to hear so take a little bit of time, talk, whatever. It won't go in any order.
Speaker F: I wanted to explore the legality and I was thinking about that in my head because that is something that's controversial and how I think AI will outpace regulation soon. So how is legality going to matter soon to a degree? How is government going to matter to a degree soon when the people that make regulation and regulation is not keeping up with the advancements? So that's kind of something I want to think about more. And I think it's really interesting for society in general, and I like that we kind of talked about how you could have a system in place to regulate advancement of society. And I was like, even though it's controversial privacy rights, but just the idea of having access to everyone's thoughts, to democratize that and make it something that could be coordinated is interesting to think about.
Speaker A: Yeah, I'll just say that there's a ton of work going on in the governance space around AI and it's probably moved faster than any other kind of response to a technology before, and it still might not be fast enough. But yeah, lots of stuff happening.
Speaker C: I think to respond to that with regulation first. With governance, I'm definitely more in the governance side because I think it can move faster and it's more practical. Whereas regulation, there's so many layers. I don't know if you're following what's happening in Europe with the AI Act. There the open letter from big tech actually in Europe, and many VCs in Europe who are saying they don't want it, it needs to change, it's going to completely slow down innovation.
Speaker D: So they're more or less they're more restricted than US regulations.
Speaker C: Yes, there's a new AI Act which just passed the European Parliament around two weeks ago, and it should come into force in the next two years, but it would have huge restrictions on all types of use cases using generated AI. So the response from that is really there's a feeling that the regulators don't really understand how the tech is actually going to be used, where the boundaries should be, that people haven't thought about it. And that's why I also agree with Ian. Maybe governance is more the way forward if there's going to be some fires around it. But from my perspective, what I've taken away from this is like that conversation around co ownership and contribution and recognition. And I just want to ponder on it a little bit more because I think there's so much that dig into in this, in how our existing system around intellectual property rewards more individual contribution, even with joint ownership. So rare to see that.
Speaker A: I'll also just plus one. That was my biggest thing. So thank you so much for bringing that forward into this conversation. I found that, like, a very interesting, positive take that helps not summarize, but it deals with a lot of if we could solve this credit problem, essentially solves a lot of other issues. And I like the abundance that comes with it. And, yeah, gave me my first. This is, like, at least the underlying motivation of some true Web Three people, not just the Hype cycle people, but the ideological. And I'll have to ponder on that.
Speaker D: I was just curious because I think you mentioned you were at Shaq 15 as well for that event. Right. I think the guy who spoke at the end, he was, like, the head of analytics at Capgemini. He's from the Netherlands. Europe. He was basically saying that. Oh, Europe. I mean, don't think that we're mean, we know what we're doing, right? I mean, do you remember he's like, we're developing, we're innovating, we're coming after Silicon Valley. I guess it's just rah rah.
Speaker E: But yeah, that's the thing.
Speaker C: They're really trying okay. They're trying to stay competitive, but just I mean, I'm still trying to get through the whole AI act.
Speaker D: 600 pages. Okay.
Speaker C: Just the way it's being written. It feels like it has been many years in the draft, but because of everything that's changing right now, there seems to be an incredible rush to get it out and said, this isn't a consideration. Exactly. This that maybe the system we're currently in isn't the system that should be the right one going forward, and there should be some thoughts around this.
Speaker D: Yeah, but maybe we'll figure out something in the future. A system that works with I wanted to talk more about, like, I'm interested in culture stuff. I actually came in, I had an idea I wanted to talk about. Like, I mentioned Walter Benjamin, who wrote about mass production of art in the stuff like that. So I wanted to a similar thing has happened with mass production of art and stuff like that. And they had ideas. What is art? Where does this take us? And stuff like that. And then there's also this whole thing about the culture industry, which I don't know, these two are like because I am a PhD student, I want to read and discuss, like, academic texts and stuff. What's your focus within anthropology? Right now, I'm a social anthropologist. Cultural anthropologist. Right. So I'm interested in social relations and culture meaning and stuff like that, but I'm interested in how people are relating to AI. So specifically, LLMs like Chat Bots on a personal level, really, like, in her?
Speaker A: Yeah. I'll just say, if you would like to kind of take responsibility for taking some people through a conversation specifically on culture and maybe even founded on a particular text, that would be cool. And you have that option both independently or if you want to under the brand and outreach of AI. Salon, I think that would be cool. Talk about it.
Speaker D: Sounds good. That's the kind of thing, like, culture industry, though, is the thing about how everything becomes automated. And, like, we're seeing kind of now with Marvel movies where it's just the same thing kind of rehashed over and over again.
Speaker A: Might be a danger with AI.
Speaker D: As well.
Speaker A: I think the culture industry kind of that is a worthwhile culture will be.
Speaker D: Diluted because everything will just be generative. It's also, like, kind of depriving us of the ability to be creative because we'll just become, like, consumers of this sludge in a sense. I don't know what I say as.
Speaker A: Well, but I think it's because we just hate the Marvel movies, prefer the new Spider verse movie, which, if you haven't seen, you definitely should see the new Spider verse movie.
Speaker D: I know you said you want to expand that point a little.
Speaker A: We're closing out. But it doesn't have to be, like, immediate you can respond. What question do you have?
Speaker D: The point was you're concerned that because we're all just going to become consumers of culture as opposed to producers of culture? Is that what you're saying? I kind of get the sense that most people just want to consume. Like, the more I talk to people I mean, you guys tell me if I'm wrong. 90% of my friends don't think about a lot of the things that I think about because they're just, like, they just want to go to work, earn that salary, and then consume. And that is why, like, TikTok and various variants of that is so popular. Most people can look at that and look at content other people produce, and they just swipe. Right.
Speaker E: So I don't know.
Speaker D: Is it just a small so what I'm saying is, with or without AI, you're always going to get the people who are not producers. But that's the question, like, I have no answer to this, but that's the question of how do we create human flourishing? If true human flourishing is actually just consuming stuff, then great, then we'll be able to do that very easily. Right?
Speaker A: Yeah. It's possible that even your friends or, like, the 90% of people, that a subset of them, if they created, if that was a bigger part of their life, they would be happier.
Speaker D: It's possible.
Speaker A: Right. And they are not supported in entering into that life because the barrier to entry to consumption is lower. It's supported more. It's the desire of all of the infrastructure around them to convert them into a consumption device. And it might not be not just a true reflection, but the only reflection of what they could be supported to be. Maybe there's like another culture around them that supports them to become creative people and maybe they would be happier, but maybe not. Maybe they would actually be their happiest as a consumption thing. And what we're seeing here is truly the revealed preference of humans. When they can get exactly what they.
Speaker D: Want can be, they still choose to. Whenever I see people who move to.
Speaker A: The suburbs, I'm like, what is happening? Why aren't you staying in walkable urban cities? And I'm like, you must be just brainwashed by a car focused culture of that. Or maybe that's actually what people want.
Speaker D: That's who they are. They live in the city to make the money so that they can move to the suburbs and live alone or have three kids and two dogs and that's what they want.
Speaker A: Maybe that fundamental American dream isn't just a story that's pushed on people, but a reflection of what people want. Maybe I would be sad.
Speaker D: I would be sad.
Speaker A: It's maybe on both sides, but this is the chicken egg of your domain.
Speaker C: I think having this conversation here in San Francisco is really interesting because most people here are builders.
Speaker D: I don't think still most. I mean most. I think we're like our day.
Speaker A: When I come home, I want to just push it into my eyeball.
Speaker D: You've just been hanging out with the elite groups who are all builders, whose true Sunday afternoon to be here, as opposed to being lounging at that. Exactly.
Speaker A: This is weird. This is a weird.
Speaker D: This is weird. Right?
Speaker C: And I think taking that into context as well.
Speaker A: Totally. But you are right that in San Francisco relative to a lot of the world, I do think I mean, I sometimes think about the idealization. So if you were in New York in the past, sometimes people make fun of San Francisco for the idea like we're going to change the world or whatever. And they cynically say that. The people saying that are using this story, they don't actually believe it's like a fiction. Right. But I appreciate that San Francisco at least idealizes impacting the world, changing the world. They idealize it so much that people have to fake it sometimes. And most cities, that's not what they idealize. That's not my picture.
Speaker D: Know, when I'm in New York, people.
Speaker A: Do not idealize impacting the world.
Speaker D: When I first got to know people in the Bay Area at Stanford, I took that approach, which is, okay, they're here to make the money, right? So the idea is just another means for them to make the money at the end of the day. So it really took me a while to get a sense that what drives tech people is very different, what drives finance Wall Street people, very different. And I fundamentally, yes, there are people in tech who make the money and then they go live extravagantly, like the Wall Street types. They buy the islands, they drink the fine wine and then they forget about building. They don't care.
Speaker A: It was a means to an end.
Speaker D: It was a means to an end. But I do feel like, as you said, San Francisco Bay Area, it glorifies or it does kind of push everybody to think about how can you change the world? And that in itself is enough. Because the life of an entrepreneur is really hard. The life of an entrepreneur is really I mean, that's why a lot of finance people are not entrepreneurs.
Speaker A: It's not the best path to making money. Definitely not.
Speaker D: So that's why a lot of people I mean, when I say and again, I've been in that crowd for most of my career, what drive finance people is very short term. This is why it's very hard to have conversations about big ideas because they're like, what's in it for me now? Right? What is it for the next three months? So that's why I do think that we need thankfully, the world is not dominated by people who have that kind of mentality. And there are people, like in the Bay Area who love building because I literally see them, people who quit their comfortable jobs at the big tech firms to do startups with literally minimal resources.
Speaker A: Maybe Nico will quit his cushy machine learning job or maybe you already did. To do stand up. To do stand up.
Speaker E: Well, I haven't, but I'm definitely in that boat, which is like it's a day job. It's not what I want to do. I am here on a visa and I need to secure that stability first. So it's very pragmatic.
Speaker A: You got to find an American partner.
Speaker D: I know that that's the practical part coming in now.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker D: I agree.
Speaker E: So I guess I'll add my closing thought there. So I joined the Commons about a month ago because I was interested in figuring out what value and meaning finding meaning itself means. And I think my core hypothesis was that there is no single path to that that everyone can take.
Speaker D: Right.
Speaker E: Like, value doesn't scale, let's say, as a hypothesis. And through other readings, through other things that I've been doing, that's what I've been thinking about. So the thing I was interested in, this particular conversation around creativity was related to that because I think a very human thing that everybody does is construct narratives out of everything we can't help it about our past life, about our futures, about our species, about our species future. So the conversation was definitely like it hit all those points for me specifically, I think the new and I guess I am on the cynical side. So for me, what Kyle was saying was very idealistic that you can just create. I don't think that can happen. I sort of agree with Ian when he was saying that social structures will probably. Not go away because drive motivation like that leads to a species progress. And the new idea, I guess, was again, related to Attribution, which as a stand up comedian, that's a fundamental issue. Did you write this joke? Are you original? Are you funny? Because it's tied to your identity, because it's a reflection on you. As a stand up comedian, you are one person on a stage. It's very individualistic and isolating. So I think that idea is very interesting to me. The fact that we might be able to trace your contribution to this giant endeavor and be able to be recognized for it in some way, in an authentic way.
Speaker D: Certainly people do stand up comedy. You got to love what you do, right? Because it's also a very arduous process, is what I understand when I watch all the Netflix documentaries about comedians.
Speaker E: You have to put in a lot of effort.
Speaker A: There are so many jobs. I heard this from a writer at something, and he's like, I've sometimes asked, why did you become a writer? And his response is like, because I couldn't do anything else. I had to write. No one would choose to be a writer.
Speaker D: It wasn't a good job.
Speaker A: And I felt similarly a little bit while being a PhD.
Speaker D: Really.
Speaker A: So PhD is like, certainly there's a difference, which PhD ends up giving you a status token at the end that you can then translate into other things, which some other things don't. But besides that very important caveat, the actual experience of doing a PhD and if you stay on the academic route is likely given your other things that the other optionalities that you probably have is not the easiest, cushiest, best paying, simplest, whatever job that you could choose. Instead, it's for a lot of people, especially during their PhD. It's going to happen to me as much. But many people, there's a lot of existential stress because you're pushing forward. You think something, but you get very little feedback. And that thing that you push forward might be almost certainly is almost irrelevant to the entirety of the world, certainly most people, but even within your field, probably irrelevant. There's a lot that makes PhD a very stressful experience for a lot of people. And so the fact that that at the end can turn into the status icon is not the best way to get that. You probably would have been better working in some field for a few years, but you do it because you thought, rightly or wrongly, that you would really enjoy being given the freedom to pursue this subset of knowledge, which is very romantic. There's something romantic about it.
Speaker D: I think also, for some people, there's this idea of not going the way that society kind of expects you to go. Like, you should go to school and then become a productive worker afterwards, right? And some people are like, I know, fuck that. I'll do something else. That's not productive. I don't want to be successful. I want to be a failure because I want to subvert stuff.
Speaker A: This is how you railed against this? I'm like, I'm going to do that. You can become a punk musician. No, I'm going to become an anthropologist. Anyway, I think we'll wrap here. So.
