Speaker A: Someone?
Speaker B: Yeah, I would.
Speaker A: Okay, good.
Speaker C: Yeah. Do we have, like, a minute before we.
Speaker B: Go. Go to the bathroom, put last, you.
Speaker A: Know what serving lines.
Speaker B: Yeah. And the bathroom is right back to the left, facilitating. Okay, sure. Hey, everyone, thanks for coming. Especially thanks for coming on time. That was really great. So this is the AI salon, who has been to the AI salon before? Andrew Zane. Great. So I'm just going to start by telling you a little bit about what the point of this gathering is, a little bit about the theme that we've chosen today. And then we're going to go around, introduce ourselves to each other, and make sure we all know each other. So the AI salon is something that Andrew and I have been running for a number of months now, and it's conversations just like this single threaded conversations with ten people on the meaning and impact of AI. We think this is a pretty important moment, that this technology is going to impact a lot of things. We think many people both have opinions that are worth hearing about, deserve to have the opportunity to think about this, impact themselves. And maybe, just maybe, we can also come to better ideas for ourselves about the future impact of AI through these kind of conversations. And so we try to direct these conversations a little bit on different themes. So today we are talking about education. So each of you, I hope both saw that you communicated some reasons why you were interested in this theme today. And so, yeah, we brought us together just to have a conversation on that topic. So before we start or start the conversation, let's just go around, and what I would love to hear is both your name and just what about education? Like, what's your relationship to education, education and AI, if there is and a question that you've been thinking about on this topic. Okay, I can start. So, I'm Ian, and my relationship to education know, obviously, I've been a student, I was a graduate student. So I've gone through many different levels of being a student and have taught undergrads and grad students. And right now I've been facilitating these kinds of things and facilitating other courses. So I've been thinking about education and having conversation a lot, and I'm interested in how AI can help us better self educate and contribute to an inverse classroom dynamic. Let's go around this way.
Speaker D: Hi, everyone. I'm Rachel, and my relationship with education, I think so. It's a big part of my identity. My whole career has been in education through private education, and then I am now at a nonprofit. So I am part of a nonprofit college access program that supports students through all the opportunities that they might not have gotten based off of their background. So I'm really interested in education equity and how AI can be a part of that and make sure that that equity is part of the conversation and not forgotten. Ming I also went through a lot of education, formal education. Mom is an educator. And so for one of the grad programs, I ended up going to a program called Educational Neuroscience. And it's half the cohort are classroom educators, the other half are neuroscience researchers. And so it's interesting to see just being thinking about practice, we're just talking about distance between practice and theory. And from that I was really interested in how machines learn and humans learn and all the things that are talked about there. And for now, what brought me to California was working for education nonprofit to help build a pathway for people in community college that are stuck on math and stats. That's like their number one barrier for graduation and usually not around what you would think. It's not the difficulty of the course, but it's more their emotional experience, learning math, not belonging in the classroom and things like that. So from that angle. So I really care about equity as well, how to get people from nontraditional backgrounds to where they need to go. Yeah. And right now on this project, AI and education, I work for a hardware company and I think the biggest Concern I have is higher Ed and K twelve are totally changing and by themselves. And also with AI just going to accelerate. So equity is going to become much bigger problem as more things, as formal education transitions, a lot more weight falls on families and community to fill the gap. And what does that look like? And alternative models and things like that.
Speaker B: Sweet.
Speaker C: Yeah. I'm Varun and I think the thing that I'm really interested in is continuing education into education outside of a traditional college environment or structure where people four years are in this environment. Outside of that, how can AI help facilitate continued explorations into a wide variety of subjects? And in particular, I've been running reading groups for almost three to four years now since I graduated college, and that's like a big part of my identity and what's important to me. And so I'm always thinking about what is a continued engagement with new ideas look like. And over the past couple of months, I've started using chat GBT quite a bit in my own education. So I work as an engineer. I've been learning a lot of new skills. Chat GBT is a big part of my development of these new skills. And maybe like a question that I've been circling around is there's some level of amputation, I think so. It's like when you learn, I think chat GBT enhances your ability to learn skills in a particular way. But it also means that I don't need to do the process of finding the relevant text and connecting all the dots because this thing will do some of that work for me. And so I'm interested in, yeah, there's that question of what is lost in that kind of education? And is something really fundamental lost there? And if so, how might we circumvent.
Speaker B: Some of those dangers? Cool.
Speaker A: I'm far tain. I'm a PhD student currently, so I'm in the educational system. I'm doing a PhD in anthropology, and as part of my PhD, I am expected to lecture and do seminars and stuff like that. Also, before I started my PhD, I also did.
Speaker E: Pedagogy.
Speaker A: Very weird, strange word.
Speaker D: I'm so curious where that came from.
Speaker A: During that time, I did some.
Speaker E: Your.
Speaker A: Place in schools to learn how middle schools and stuff like that to learn how to educate. So, yeah, obviously I'm very curious in how I could use AI to help educate people better. Like use it for lectures, use it for seminars. And I guess also because I'm from Europe and from Northern Europe especially, there's more of a German philosophical concept of bildum, like character building when it comes to education, as opposed to just like, learning skills.
Speaker B: Got it?
Speaker A: Yeah. I'm excited about this conversation.
Speaker B: We're just going around right now, introducing ourselves. We haven't gotten to this part, so you'll be introduced yourself later, but just as a quick introduction, the AI salon. We're going to have a long conversation about the meaning and impact of AI in education. We've had some introduction from different people who have related to education in different ways, from either working in nonprofits focused on equity or being a teacher or just being a student themselves. And now we're at Andrew.
Speaker F: Okay, I'm Andrew.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker F: I've also spent lots of time, lots of time of my life in education, like most of my 20s. So I have a couple of thoughts on this. One is like, this stuff is so good to help you learn things because it's personalized and you can ask the questions directly. I think this kind of dialogue based learning is always more effective for both myself and also when you teach things to other people, too, you learn it well as well. Right? So I think I was really bad at math in high school and really bad fundamentals in math and then didn't really get good at that till later in life, and kind of had always internalized this narrative of, I'm not a math person, and I'm like, I don't write math, so I just do that stuff instead. And I realized that was really just self limiting belief that's common in early education, where we kind of segment ourselves into different kinds of people. And so I think also now we like to think we live in a meritocracy, where people are rewarded according to their achievements and their potential. But I think education is a big gatekeeper to that. And so democratizing access to quality tutors and better education services is pretty much, like, the best means by which we can actually achieve meritocracy, where people have an equal shot at learning and developing their potentials. Yeah. So it's kind of like, I guess, my interest. Awesome.
Speaker A: Everyone, my name is Jaroslav. I grew up in Siberia. I went to university here. So I also spent time in different education systems around the world, and I was a tutor as well. And something I'm really interested in is how we have a lot of talented people around the world, but we're not actually, as a society, utilizing the majority of that latent talent that exists in people. And the two things that I'm really excited about are, one, the Internet and the fact that everybody, almost everybody, has access to the Internet today. That's changed very recently. And that's something that I have seen play a big role in my life, where throughout my life, I've had different times, where I've learned things at different speeds. I've almost had different approaches to learning. I tried to learn through school. That wasn't exactly the pace of education that I needed. I tried to learn through work that also didn't match it as much. And the only way that I was able to actually get personalized education that fit me was through the Internet, because it's always there, it's always available. But the problem that I think exists for a lot of these people is that the Internet is such a huge space, and you don't often know what to do with it. Those ideas that maybe will help you unlock that next level or the subjects or the skills, you don't actually know. There are a lot of unknown unknowns. So what I'm really interested in is how can we guide people through this path of growth, from being in the middle of nowhere, just a kid, somewhere in the forest, and like a small town, to actually learning things and having curiosity and living a happy life. And I think that language models, and AI in general can help us create that guiding force in this big sea of the Internet.
Speaker E: Hi, I'm Wenchi.
Speaker D: My dad's a professor, but also just been interested in education for a while. My concern that they are more similar to her rooms, I guess one was just like, how do we preserve critical thinking skills and the act of synthesizing and collecting information? If you have an AI, kind of just spit out the answer at you. Especially for kids who are more, I guess, more in the university level education space. And then another problem that I was talking about with a friend is. So I currently work at Webflow and.
Speaker E: My friend has a no code mobile.
Speaker D: App platform and we can use AI to kind of solve the cold Star.
Speaker E: Problem because a lot of the problems.
Speaker D: With our platforms is, it's really hard to know, but they're also used to teach. Like, this is how web programming works, this is a box model, this is the fundamentals of mobile apps and the.
Speaker E: Components that go in.
Speaker D: So you can use GPT or whatever to kind of just solve that problem and start you like 80% from where you were. But what do you lose if you're not actually learning the principles of what's happening and instead you're developing kind of the less fundamentals? Now that we've made it much easier for anyone to develop and what is the right thing, you really should be.
Speaker E: Teaching kids, or not kids, but young adults.
Speaker A: I am Sharath from India, visiting here, Big Sci-Fi Reader, and a lot of my learning in school and college, I struggled in the system, but I tend to learn from outside of that system. And so it's after schooling in college that I actually began to discover myself a lot more. Had a very fun and interesting career so far. Over the last five years, I've been deeply involved in the data privacy space. And right now I'm sort of bringing together that experience and what's happening with the world of AI to facilitate sort of personalization, with privacy and perception of what one needs to learn or find about themselves, their interests, but specifically around education have actually failed. Building company in India for the rural market that focused on sort of preparing a lot of the students who would only come into the market with some level of functional skills, just mostly road learning. And it would take a long time to develop understanding about what the market really needs. What's the work culture like and how do you bring together all of this? The last thing is I'm particularly interested in my personal capacity, working with mostly youngsters, trying to help them design interesting careers in today's world. And what's happening with this LLM revolution? It just throws interesting questions. And I think we were discussing what does it mean for youngsters today to who's going to hire and what are they going to hire for? What are you going to learn? How do you really prepare yourself for working?
Speaker B: Cool. Jesse.
Speaker A: Hi, everyone, I'm Jesse. So like most people here, I've been in the receiving end of education for a good chunk of my life. And so as an observer of that, noted that it seems not optimal. So it's a lot of memorization and not really understanding and then a lot of subsequent forgetting. So in retrospect, you look back and think of all the link I learned, like three different languages and I forgot them all very suboptimal. And so I've always been interested in how we can make that more meaningful and given the amount of time we spend in that. And so I work on the AI side of things. And so I've always thought one interest in mind has been AI tutoring. So like intelligent tutoring systems as a way to change that from just sort of receiving information and memorizing to being more interactive and more. But then it's kind of like a case of be careful what you wish for, because AI has moved so fast now that there are also all these negative effects of AI. And so trying to understand, like, for example, systems that automatically will generate essays, things like that. And so I work in AI, and as things turn to generative AI, I'm kind of also struggling with these new capabilities and also how they present problems, so how they might break existing paradigms of education and testing, essay writing that they no longer really work in the same way because people are access to these tools. So I'm kind of also trying to see that very negative, the negative applications of some of the technology. And also there's new opportunities that people are saying the whole set of skills that people need is changing now. And so how we kind of refactor education around that is also interesting. Justin hi, my name is Hansa. Unlike most of here, I didn't give much thought to AI and how to really change education or anything like that. I was just a university wanted Chad GBT to give answers specific to my course or more specific answers, so I could kind of use those answers. That's what I'm looking to build.
Speaker F: An.
Speaker A: AI that kind of knows all course information about a university student course and then can give more personalized learning to that student. So I came at it from a simple way, but if you really think about it I think it could be a big change for college students and to give personalized learning to a lot of students. So in that aspect, it's pretty transformational.
Speaker B: Hi everyone, my name is Roy and to me, education was a game changer. So I'm an investor today. But I came from a background that should have pointed to no ODs of want to do what I'm doing today. Came from a family that didn't know a lot about education or finance or any sort of formal training and still didn't know what I was going to do with my life by the time I graduated college. So it wasn't until later that I got to the master's degree that it completely changed the trajectory of my life. So when I think about education, it really unlocks access. And today I'm kind of trying to pay it forward. I do a lot of coaching, education coaching and career coaching on the side, and I typically tend to choose candidates who are the least likely to get into whatever it is that they want to get in. Because to me, I think that's the whole point of coaching, is to equalize and to increase access. So recently I came across, I think just yesterday article that California Board of Education decided to leave out algebra from middle school education and a lot of kids in the name of diversity. So they noticed that there is a wide range of receptivity in the classroom based on race. And the board had two choices, either to pull the bottom or push down the top, and they chose the easier route by pushing down the top. So to me, AI has potential of really tailoring a personal learning experience so that all the folks, even from the bottom, can receive the help of me and close the gap so that we can pull the bottom. Love it. Would you like to? Sorry, I don't know your name.
Speaker E: Yeah, sorry. I'm so sorry for being late. I know this is from before, but my name is Lakshar Toshi. I just graduated last month from Karpura. I'm natively from India. I'm here for a month and a half in San Francisco. So how I stumbled upon, I think, chat GT sort of view the entire preface of how we think about using search and how we think about interacting with the system. I think it was an insanely powerful tool for me being a research student myself. One of the three critical problems basically we stumbled upon in our college and in our communities. One was, I think there is a long tail problem even in the research community. And when I say research communities, it basically means researchers, PhD, postdocs, professors. So if, let's say you are in a Stanford or an MIT, or you publish in a top journal, you get the chance to access the top level of grants and top level of resources for a lot of professors and a lot of students who are just starting, they're not able to get that kind of impact or visibility even if they publish their research papers. And there is a gentle lot of ecosystem creating around, sort of enabling the top percentile. So that was one problem. And second, I think there is this bigger movement known as the DSI movement in Web three, which is to sort of enable people to get more grants for uplifting, like lesser known or lesser popular fields. So a lot of times, even in colleges, like with AI and computer science being hot, they get most of the investments and most of the attention, but a lot of these different fields don't get that much attention, which is necessary for a broader, let's say, survival of the human race and progress of human science. So another way we were thinking of trying to build and boost better visibility was to sort of enable people from all of these different subdomains to showcase their impact and have a better metric than, let's say, an H index or citation to connect with the right communities.
Speaker B: Awesome.
Speaker E: Those are two broad things which I'm passionate about with AI education.
Speaker B: Yeah, this was an awesome introduction. So as we go forward, at least for the first few times, when you speak up, just remind us your name just so we can all keep track. One thing I also want to mention is I'm actually recording this conversation. It's being recorded, however well my iPhone can do it. We're going to be using this information. We try and derive summaries from this. We will not communicate who said anything. To the degree that we release any aspects of this, it will be anonymized. But I just want everyone to be aware of that. So a bunch of themes came up, but I want to start in maybe a very broad question that we can dig into for a little bit, which is what is the purpose of education and who is it for? Okay, let's start there for a moment. Take a few moments to think, but I'd love to hear it.
Speaker D: And we're thinking about formal education specifically.
Speaker B: No, we're not thinking. So if you want to start, like, you don't have to fully answer the question, but if you want to start offering dimensions that we can start to think about. So you're bringing up formal education versus.
Speaker D: Informal learning or continued learning.
Speaker B: So formal education is like something that's.
Speaker D: In classroom, teacher, in the front right like structure facilitated to what extent these two buckets still exist in five to ten years is of great interest. But I think up till this point, there were different things. So informal learning broadly is referred to things like everything from learning from YouTube to summer camp to after school programs. Everything does not happen within the K twelve higher ed system.
Speaker F: I could propose two ideas on what is education, and the two ideas are a little bit different. One is socializing people to take part in society as people who can collaborate on things, that understand social norms, how to meet strangers, how to make friends, how to build trust, that kind of stuff. That's a big function of socializing for our education as we practice it. And the other side is society has gotten so big and so complex. There's so much to get caught up on, to participate and contribute both within existing capacities, but then also to push the frontiers of new capacities. And that's probably where we think of a lot of formal education, higher ed, secondary educate, that kind of stuff. It's like I'm specializing in topics that are going to be built upon by others and that kind of stuff.
Speaker A: So reminding everybody my name, I'm Jaroslav. Building on what the past two people said, the purpose of education. I'm looking at this from the perspective of what role education has played historically. I think there are three layers. I almost think of it as like the mass, local pyramid of needs, where at the base layer you have survival. So it's Hunter Gatherer times. You basically got what I would think was informal education at the time, but it basically was given to you so that you could survive and contribute to the survival of the tribe that you belong to. The middle layer is the economic productivity. And that's where I think once we moved to the agricultural societies and we basically started having states. States needed people to have skills that normally a person doesn't just have or doesn't potentially learn from their family, because maybe their Family doesn't know how to be ascribed or they don't know how to write. And so that's both the economic productivity of the person contributing to the society that they live in, and also that society extracting something from that person. And the top layer of the pyramid is happiness. And that's something that is, in some sense, this is also the ultimate goal, like survival and economic product happiness. But it's not something you really get to do unless you are really well educated. Just how do you live a life that is the type of life that you want to live? Most people getting education today, they don't learn that, even if they learn how to be economically productive. And just to finish this off, building on what Andrew said was that how do we actually get people to do this? I think the first two layers are like, for the survival of the economic productivity, we have the transfer of culture, which borders on indoctrination. In some sense. You're kind of getting indoctrinated into the human civilizational culture. At the same time, you're also learning about what are the issues that exist with our society today, with our civilization. What should you work on? How can you actually be economically productive? And that's interception. It takes longer and longer, actually, to learn those things. You have to specialize more and more if you actually want to learn about those issues. And finally, and hopefully is what you can get is the critical thinking skills and the reasoning skills and the understanding that you can actually create things in this world and be the master of your life. In some sense, I think that contributes to that top happiness level, but that's mostly missing from a lot of the education right now.
Speaker B: Anyone else want to build on that? Jeffrey?
Speaker A: Yeah, building on.
Speaker B: Looking at this from like a Northern. Thank you for saying your name. Can we just farte?
Speaker A: Sorry about that. Building on this from like a northern European standpoint or viewpoint, education in Northern Europe really started after the Protestant Reformation with the Lutherans. And just looking at the Scandinavian welfare state system and their education, it was really about. I liked where you were at with the societal needs and economic needs and all of that also. But education for much of human history has also always kind of had this spiritual element to it where it's like the Lutherans stayed. Like they didn't teach kids to read because they wanted them to be economically productive. They taught kids to read because they wanted them to read the Bible. And that kind of had the by effect of them becoming better citizens or whatever. In the Danish nation state at that.
Speaker B: Point.
Speaker A: It'S like the 17 hundreds must.
Speaker B: Be a six to 17, right?
Speaker A: And it's like the rise of the Danish welfare state. I was reading about that. So if you read that history, you can kind of see it. And then just looking at history, you always had these kind of mentor student relationships, right, where the guru in ancient Greece, you have the mentor student kind of relationship, which I think is more of like a spiritual thing, right. But this mass education that we see today is kind of new, right. And that has to do with the needs of the state and the needs of. I guess it's different here in the US than it is back in Europe, because back in Europe, it's very much the need of the nation state, right. So it's like we're producing workers and we're producing citizens, particularly like citizens with a particular nation or nationality. Right. So you're like homogenizing the populace.
Speaker B: Right.
Speaker A: You're, like indoctrinating them in a sense.
Speaker D: Right. Currently, it's been referred to as industrial era education because industrialization happened and we need to, therefore classrooms happen and classrooms need to be at work in the factories. Kids need to be babysat and summer needs to be off so they can go harvest.
Speaker B: It sounds a little bit like Andrew's point of socializing people to be part of a society is a reasonable umbrella over very different kinds of, you know, in the smaller Lutheran society, their purpose for education, you're saying, was to bring people into their moral framework, which was a spiritual goal. But I think we can nicely nest that under socializing people to be part of a society and the industrialized education is doing this for a very different kind of societies. Rachel, I'm curious, to the extent that you as teacher and the Education institute you're part of explicitly describe the purpose of education. What do you all talk about, either explicitly or implicitly?
Speaker D: Yeah, so, Rachel, and something I didn't mention in my intro is that I'm a teacher. I'm a fourth and fifth grade teacher in the public schools, SS public schools. And I think we really should, in our teacher prep programs, just sit down and talk about what education is. In my teacher prep programs, it really was like, let's talk about how to teach kids and the things that we have to teach them. So I think everyone actually has a different definition. When you're training to be a teacher, you probably have a different definition of what education should be in terms of what the government tells us in standardized testing and the things that we have to do for our job. It really is the second component to what Andrew was saying of building the skills that they would need to find a job that works best for them. Right. Like the technical skills. And you really don't see that community or social skills that we're talking about in the first wave of how do you be a good person? You really don't see that in any government mandated thing. But, of course, as teachers, you want to embed that. So it's often a challenge for teachers to do both. And so I've seen colleagues really focus on let's be good people, let's understand diversity, inclusivity. And that's more important than being grade level in math. And then you see other students or other teachers who are the reverse, where it's like we need to meet these standards. This is what my job tells me to do. And it's really important for these kids in their growth for the next year. I would be failing as a teacher if they are under grade level. And then, of course, the goal, as any teacher is to be both. And that's where it's very challenging, the way that the US education system sets us up for. So I'm not sure if that really answered your question, but that's, I mean.
Speaker B: I don't think what is the purpose of education going to have an answer, but I think we are. Ruben, did you want to build on this?
Speaker C: I love that we're setting up this tension here between education for doing things in the world, for doing things for the society that you're part of, and then education as this spiritual exercise for oneself that tames one's mind in particular ways, maybe develops one's character, though that's even if it's not moral education, right? The process of learning on its own, even if you're not learning about morality, is somehow shaping character. That's really interesting to me, and it's interesting because I went to a college where the life of the mind was what it was about. And so it was almost like, oh, you shouldn't be thinking too much about the practical usage of the stuff that you're learning. That's like cutting against the point of what you're doing.
Speaker D: I don't think Chicago was extremely ill equipped us for this.
Speaker B: Right.
Speaker C: So we both went to Uchicago, and that's what I'm referencing. Certain. But it's interesting. I'll just throw out there that most of the ways that I think about how AI will affect education is in terms of how it increases our capacities for doing things in the world. And this is sort of like the theory behind most, like, continue education. It's like, I want to do something. There's something I want to do at my job. I need to learn something in order to do that. And so that learning is connected to doing. It's interesting to think about what is learning on its own and what are the virtues of that. And, yeah, I guess I'll just throw it out there. It's just like interesting tension that we're getting at.
Speaker D: Can I respond to that? Yeah. Okay. So I think what's interesting is the Chinese word for education is two parts. So Jiao means to teach. Yu means to nurture. So it's always meant to be the transfer of knowledge and the nurturing of human being, right? So in every higher ed institution there's this thing that's like it takes ten years to plant a tree, it takes 100 years to cultivate a person. I mean, by that time you're dead. So the point, I think that's the tension you're mentioning. And I think somehow in the industrialized era, education, especially higher ed, has taken on. It has evolved from this spiritual institution, including where we went to college, used to be a seminary, and then evolved into divinity school and then became college. And it's evolved from that to producing workers credential for working to now what's next? Right? I think that's an interesting point. The second point was connected to the doing part for a while. Being armchair academic is like what worked and would produce theories that drove the world, right? And then are we still in that world or are we fundamentally different? Including Uchicago, we're moving to college like ten years on. Suddenly the tiny two room apartment that's computer science is now one of the most biggest undergrad majors in a college that says we will teach nothing practical. And how is that changing? It's very interesting. And how would AI continue to change that?
Speaker B: I wonder if one way that Yoroslav brought know this kind of Maslow's hierarchy of education, where presumably happiness is where we can get to. And you kind of articulated that, an ideal that, rather than using the word indoctrination, though, I think that that's a reasonable word. Communicating the important problems in the world, the problem space, and giving you the ability to figure out how you relate to those important problems is a powerful source of both. Important, like making use of human resources in the world, and also for many people, I'm guessing, personal fulfillment. In an agency, you have the capacity and the agency to discover how to relate to the world. You weren't completely left alone with no structure, and were given the tools to do something meaningful and meaningful. Being defined by a story around you, the national story, the spiritual story, whatever. And so, I don't know, I hope I'm going to move us off from this topic, that there might be a way where this tension between spiritual fulfillment and practical contribution to the world can be made in alignment when done perfectly.
Speaker A: Yeah, you want to checkpoint that off. Going off what you say? Because I think there's actually a dimension along which the spiritual and the practical are one and can be just placed along an axis. And that dimension is learning about the issues in the more general world, learning about the possibilities, almost like the search space of possibilities of living your life. And one thing you could do is you could learn about your spirituality. Another one is you could understand how to be practical in society, but you need to know that those things actually exist. If you've never been taught about spirituality, you might feel like a little itch in yourself, but you want to know that you can explore that path. And I would really like to talk to people more about expanding of the space of possibilities in one's head. I once started a non profit, like a little research program where we basically took kids from the middle of nowhere. We would take kids from a lot of places in Russia, from Kazakhstan. We had some kids from India, and we would match them with professors at American universities. We had some really great professors, Princeton, Yale, and they would do research together in some really interesting know. Some of them were tech related, like ML, some of them were like bio law. And the whole idea wasn't to teach them about that particular topic, but it was to just show them that, hey, you were like a kid from the middle of nowhere. You can actually create knowledge.
Speaker B: Did you know that?
Speaker A: You can create knowledge? That's actually a really interesting idea that you probably haven't heard of. And We've seen some pretty big change in people's mindsets that took me personally, like maybe five, seven years to actually walk through, but they just had to experience it once to always be able to see it in the future.
Speaker B: Yeah. Not to just privilege these intellectual pursuits. I know that there were some people from, for instance, my high school who didn't do well in high school. All of the ways that they were seeing how they can contribute probably didn't feel right to them. And one of them became like an animal rescue worker and found another way that they could relate to life, which wasn't put within their perspective beforehand. And they actually found something that they could align very well and was useful. I do want to spend a little bit more time setting a little bit more groundwork, but moving away from the purpose of education to, oh, you want to.
Speaker F: I was going to add one more thing just on the, because I thought it's just in the null space, what's been mentioned so far. So in terms of what education, I thought it's important just put on the table for future discussion that education is extremely political, and it's always been a political tool, at least since Plato's Republic, which is a book about how to indoctrinate your population to be perfect citizens in an ideal state. So the invention of nationhood is very much tied to the invention of modern education and the imagined community that we all think we belong to. And the construction of national narratives that place us in a relative position to other countries and then justify certain policies and foreign policy decisions that may be less popular in the places they're enacted. And so, yes, we had colleges of divinity, which, for spiritual enlightenment of a select few. More commonly, we had trade guilds, which were for the passing down of a specific craft and trade guilds became very powerful and centralized. Governments didn't like that. And one way to break them up was in the standardization of educational institutions. So I just wanted to put that Today, education is incredibly political.
Speaker B: I love it as well. Relates to Fartain's point earlier with like, education is for the state. And I think another. We can see the spiritual first skills based tension we've been seeing as also like, personal first state relationship. So the last question, which could be a large one, is who should we be focusing on when we think about education? Because we can talk about a lot of things, but we've already heard about continued education. While a lot of us talk about the opportunities to become self fulfilled and enter into a world different from our background, which leads a little bit more younger in my mind, some people have specifically brought up children, and we've also had the potentially overlapping dimension of formal versus informal, which is also often, at least the formal education is a young applied.
Speaker D: I do think that the reason why to separate formal education from learning is exactly the tension we've been all talking about. Learning is driven by the learner's need to grow as humans, and education is tied to state politics and indoctrination. So I think that separation becomes more important at this point in time.
Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. Anyone else want to add? I'm going to also push us a little bit to this side of the room. Anyone want to bring up things you're thinking about in terms of the who? When thinking about how we should be conceptualizing education here, is it important to. Maybe you can deny the premise like that? It's not relevant.
Speaker E: I think just sort of drawing parallels and connecting both the points which we had discussed. I think, first of all, myself, Lakshwanth, again. And I think the broader idea, if we see the historical narrative as civilizations progressed, I think humans fundamentally needed certain junctures to sort of be cohesive and be more functional. And they started right when there were, like, Neanderthals or let's say very back when we basically needed to form communities. And then we needed mediums to exist and to sort of foster as a civilization. So I think from that stage, we developed languages, we developed means of communication. So that is like a more natural way of thinking about the needs of the human civilization and to survive. Two, I think over a progress of HP, we reached a stage where education or the control of knowledge was more centralized because the access of resources became more centralized to certain people before, let's say, to the New age or to the current age, where we have more democratization of education or knowledge per se. So I think when we talk about state controlling the education or state controlling the narrative, I think it's also important to understand that today education per se is also, to a certain extent, extremely democratized. I get it. Like, it's not equal for everybody to get access to all the information, but considering how the civilization has progressed, I think there has been huge changes and huge leapfrog.
Speaker D: Yes.
Speaker E: So from that perspective, I think when we talk about stakeholders and who we should think about focusing on education, I think two main thoughts or two main lines of discussion, which I would want to ponder upon is a. I think how fundamentally the incentives have been aligned for, let's say, the state, the nation, the overall society. I think those are more broader structural changes which can't change even in, let's say, the next 200, 300 years because of the pace of civilization, it should progress. So certain elements need to remain same for the society to function as a moral construct here. And second, I think with more democratization, with more access, with AI coming in the leapfrog, and with, let's say, the need for one on one interactions, need for humans decreasing, we should also focus upon how the ethical discussion here comes in. Like how basically, are we giving the right information? Is the right information reaching the right person? Is it being controlled? Is it being uncensored or not?
Speaker B: So am I hearing you right that one of the things you brought up was organizations, not just formal education, but once you have an organization like Harvard, it becomes an mean. It's called an educational institution, but it has other purposes, right? Exactly. It's a research place. It's a way to help us brand people in different ways. It has lots of purposes outside of its goal of education. And those purposes are not necessarily bad purposes, but they're not education purposes specifically. And institutions don't change very fast, while the technology that might change the best way for us to educate ourselves might be changing much faster. Is that one of the points you're highlighting?
Speaker E: That's one of the points. And second, I think is the broader democratization which we can have with technology or even with the amount of information which we have access to. So I think earlier the information was much more controlled, much more concentrated on how much can be granted to citizens with the concept of nations, with the concept of boundaries, with the concept of books being available, or even the pre printing age.
Speaker B: Yeah. Let me ask just a question. We can kind of poll a little bit, so spend a couple of seconds thinking about this, and then we'll raise our hands. But do people here think that the rise of AI technology in relationship to education is going to weaken or lessen the need for formal education structures? Just think about that. So if you raise your hand, you think that AI technology is going to lead to a weakening or like lack of need for formal education structures to meet the goals of education that we just talked about.
Speaker D: Can I offer a third option?
Speaker B: No.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker B: We only have one hand, right? Let's just stay there and then we can move on on the conversation. So does everyone have in mind whether they're raising their hand or not? Okay. Please raise your hand if you think it's going to weaken educational, formal educational things. Okay, so we have a number of people who didn't. I saw three of you. And are you the only three that didn't raise your hand, Wenchi? A little bit.
Speaker D: Okay, yeah, so I'm Wenchi. I think, actually, kind of parodying your previous question.
Speaker E: I think a huge question has been.
Speaker D: I think formal education through K through twelve is kind of taken for granted around the world, that it's necessary, and it's usually universally provided for everyone. But I think college is kind of the crux of a lot of people opt into it, even where it's free. In other countries, I think the capacity is very limited to what the population.
Speaker E: Of the country is.
Speaker D: I think with COVID it was like, hey, what is the point of learning? Is it just lectures? If we're all going to be watching lectures from home, why are we signing up for colleges? And then to your point, it's like the elite, the super Elite, they have the brand name and that's what you're paying for. And then there's a community colleges that are more vocational, but then there's this huge chunk in the middle. It's like, what is the value of those college programs?
Speaker B: Okay, good.
Speaker D: So your question about formal education, I was like, kind of, what do we then need education as a signaling more as a signaling thing in this world where it's more accessible with AI, and that's where the need for it is actually stronger, where it's like, hey, I need to prove my credentials somewhere else. And that's where the need for maybe like a college degree or a master or just like I'm trying to figure.
Speaker B: Out where that totally institutions do many things. And if AI led to college not being as necessary for education, we still might need a way for people to signal to others that I'm actually really smart or something like that. The other three people who were, I guess, in the minority of this. Do you want to substantiate kind of your perspective here?
Speaker D: Yeah, I think going back to the first point that we talked about of like, there's two different types of education. There's building the technical skills and there's building the society. From my knowledge of AI, I don't think that AI will substitute that community portion of it. And that I really feel is very strong, very important in our formal education, because you'll have learners anywhere in the world that are driven to learn. And so they will love anything that they get through AI. But there's a majority of young students like K Twelve are more of the like, I need guidance. I need someone to believe in me, show that they're interested in who I am as a person. And that's where they're going to buy into learning. And with that buy in, then they can go on their own. So I really do think that at least K twelve, it won't weaken or AI won't weaken that structure. I agree with that. I think we all know probably one or two home school friends that socially really challenged. And I think that was that offensive. I think that's really important for K Twelve, mostly about confidence building, learning how to learn, not having math anxiety, feel belonging, like all these fundamental being human traits that just hard to do without community. And I feel like for higher Ed, we've already seen the evolution from them being more spiritual institutions like divinity schools that became colleges and now became credential vehicles, which actually is not the right role, in my opinion, for higher Ed. And with AI, I'm really excited that we're able to return higher ed institutions to what they were designed to do, which are gathering places for people to have discussions. And I think we see this in Israel and the Jewish tradition phase too, right? Like people actually gather and debate. That's what higher ed institutions were made for, rather than this full service based campus experience for people to gain a certain credentialing. And I don't know how much of that is necessary going forward if we're going more from a thinking to a doing world. If you can make something happen, who cares if you have a degree? I do agree in this. I mean, we're already seeing 800 college closures in the United States alone in the past five years. The number is going up. So yes, it will be different. That's where the third option I was going to offer is. It doesn't mean it'll get weakened. It'll just be completely different. We will go to college to debate and have the experience we have at the Commons, rather than sitting there as robots and machines acquiring knowledge for 16 years at a time, which is total inefficient use of our time.
Speaker B: Yeah. I was also thinking as another higher ed both functions as both educator and branding cake through twelve functions as both education and daycare. Daycare, that is actually a relevant use. And even if kids were like educating themselves, not only would they need a place to work on the social bonds and learn to learn and all the things you said, we just need a space for them to go. And we would like that space to be relevant for them and efficient for their time.
Speaker D: That became to be because all the workers need to be in the factory and we no longer need that nowadays. So can we return back to, I think, across eastern Western traditions? There has been smaller homeschooling groups, right? And that's how the most effective education, like in this place in China, they are all basically giant tube of. Giant thing of a community where like 300 people live in it. And they have consistently turned out the best scholars. It's like community based education. Like basically what Commons and neighborhoods trying to build, right? So the community educates these pool of kids together and then they go off and do their thing. But that's very different from individual families sending kids to schools and that industrial mass production process. But is there an age. Sorry, at which that happens? Is it, what is 1218 or like 15? Or. I don't know if you need it at like five, right? Maybe ideally community based. I mean, this applies to community based therapy, community based production. Maybe AI could bring us to more of a hyper local kind of future, right? Where that. And undo a lot of damage that global mass production and globalization have done. There's a lot of advantages too. I don't know which way is going to go, but that's just one possible way for education.
Speaker B: Yeah, we talk sometimes about not just these hyper local communities maybe having access to this futuristic tutor that at least democratizes access to a good lecturer or something like that, but also even the kind of facilitation that we're doing right now totally is a skill, as we were talking about before, facilitation of group discussion. And there's no reason to think that that, too, couldn't be improved by AI. So maybe one of the biggest questions here is, like, what is supported by AI? And given that certain aspects of education that were previously scarce, resources are no longer scarce, let's just imagine, like, expertise.
Speaker C: I was actually really curious about Fortine's reason for not. For not thinking that AI would diminish formal education structures.
Speaker A: No, actually, I couldn't say it better than it's already been said. But, yeah, I was just also thinking that you talked about the kind of indoctrination purpose of kind of education as well. Right. Always kind of be mindful of that. These formal institutions can be used for wrong or evil, I guess. But, yeah, I totally agree with everything.
Speaker B: That'S been said over here.
Speaker A: So I don't know if we can add anything, but you need community, and.
Speaker B: You need to learn how to learn.
Speaker A: And you need kind of.
Speaker B: I thought you added something, though, to just say that if a state has a need to indoctrinate like the state wants it, then they will create. Make sure that there are opportunities for that indoctrination, regardless of what are the educational intents, because that's the goal of this.
Speaker D: I know you're speaking a lot. I just want to add one little point to that. And to your point about why harbor exists, I realized why basically, each nation has some equivalent of that public institution, right? It's a public institution. It's on the map. It's heavily branded. It does not mean that it necessarily has better, higher level learning than many other places, but it serves a few. Like, on paper, it looked very similar to Chicago. Like when they're for grad school. That's like, this is going to be a really exciting learning experience. It's not. It serves a function of being a knowledge marketplace. We don't have that structure. Maybe we will in the future. In which case, higher ed public higher education places may not exist, but it serves the place. The function of people going there, and they are exchanging knowledge for something else or for knowledge itself. I don't know if that's like a lot of other institutions are knowledge generations, but public institutions as such is to influence how the rest of the world thinks about certain topics. And every nation needs that for nation state building purposes. And then also it needs to make a statement about where things are going. Right. So there's 150 leadership classes across the board at Harvard. That's way more than many other institutions of its similar qualities. So I'm wondering why that's the case. It's kind of like it's for the geopolitical reasons that was mentioned. So I think that for those reasons, every nation will fight for higher ed to continue to exist for some kind of political reasons.
Speaker F: If you look at England, just a quick thought on that. If you look at England, the different schools are all about class reproduction. Eden College and the accent you get and whether you go to a public or private school is completely the class device. So that's very overt, I guess. Very conscious on their part.
Speaker E: I think it should probably interesting discussion. I believe there are a couple of aligned incentives which go in out there, even for reasons like how it exists. I think very fundamental reasons, like humans want a signal, humans want the branding, how the human race has sort of thought about institutions, and then how overall I think the nation states feel about the Delta advantage which human capital can bring in. Like economies like South Korea, Japan, and even a lot of these nation states who are very resource scale have been able to incrementally boost their per capita income just because of the sheer human capital which they have been able to invest in. So I think there are different incentives which lead to different conclusions. And the lines become like little fuzzy if we pick the nuances, like why certain things work certain ways, I think there can be like. It's like a pretty complex structure. Coming back to the main question, which I think you asked, I agree that. I agree with the premise here that K twelve is more fundamental and requires more general skills and more ways of living which need to be inculcated. But we shouldn't ignore the micro changes which will start happening when I think AI's democratization and the cheap usage of AI would enter. So for example, something like, let's say the cost for a query becomes very less with the amount of investment which is being done. Then every kid might have their own bot which they can communicate to over a period of time. And then this also becomes a way of a new paradigm of things which can start happening, and how we think about things and how we think about education. Like certain things which are taught at certain age can be totally changed and totally altered just because the way the society would progress in that nature.
Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree. Let's move in this direction where we'll start to think about how this democratized access to unbelievable power might have these microchanges. So, Hamza, I kind of wanted to go to you. So you were bringing up, I think, during the introduction, the ways that chat, GBT and LMS are impacting or affecting your own educational experience now, and the ways that it's kind of making clear certain kinds of incentives, like whether you're trying to educate yourself or whether you're trying to achieve the near term goals of the course. Can you talk us through a little bit about the ways you see GPT type models already having these kind of micro changes to education.
Speaker A: So what I've seen and how I think about it is you can sort of use AI as it's getting better, as its own teacher, for example. And so if it has all the knowledge, it's been trained on the whole Internet, if it understands what, for example, a freshman of college should know, right. It can give you a more personalized, step by step teach you as long as it takes if you're a fast learner, slow learner, right. And so in the future, technically it should be the best teacher available, much better than any human could do. But there's also the aspect of the human aspect of education, so that's always going to be a necessity. But for practicality, I believe an AI with complete knowledge, all the confidence and stuff you should know, should be able to teach you step by step over time, however long it takes you, everything you want to learn or it needs to get a degree, for example, certified for whoever decides you pass the exam and so forth. So it should overall be the best teacher. But that also is a question of the human aspect and how necessary is it in education and so forth.
Speaker B: Yeah, I think some people brought up earlier on ideas around becoming overreliance. So the AI tutor might know everything and could be an amazing teacher, but the human has to want to learn, right? Want to interact, want to be incentivized. I wonder if anyone has thoughts about how, as the capabilities of these systems increase, how are the incentives of humans going to change, and is that going to be beneficial for human learning?
Speaker E: I think just a small thought there. I think one big question with all these AI systems was, good teachers are the ones who make students ask questions or make them encourage the ability to think about situations or think about problems instead of handing them the answer on the platter. So one big question with good AI systems or them being good teachers is can they foster the curiosity in the child by not giving him the answer, but by slowly, like, peeling the layers and helping him come to the.
Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. No, I love what y'all are talking about. And I was actually going to mention sort of this point that you were saying. In my head, I like to compare this to situations that don't involve AI, but AI performing very similar functions to something like having a private tutor that I'm talking to, right. Who they grew up with me since I was like five. And every single year, every day after school, I go to this person and they teach me certain things they know. How does Varun learn best? What are his strengths? What are his weaknesses? How to best frame, you know, maybe this sort of mathematical concept. He will learn best by this kind of visual. Let me show him that. And, like. Right. How do I foster curiosity? And so part of that problem of that tutor, like, how to put the student in a place in a situation where they want to learn, right? And I think sometimes school is really bad at that because the approach is sort of a one size fits all. And so there is some really creative potential there for an AI. But like, a bad tutor I would go to, and they would be like, this is the answer to all your homework. Let's move on.
Speaker B: Right?
Speaker C: And part of this comes down to, I kind of want to say implementation details. I mean, there's more to it, but walking over, I was like, oh, AI is going to be probably not really good for education. And then this thought experiment was something I started mulling over and was like, actually, this sounds really cool, like something that knows how I learn. The ways that I learn has been with me for decades, can help frame things that I experience in the world in a way that I'm best able to understand it. I think that is potentially really powerful.
Speaker B: This is the universal translator idea where we all actually speak different languages, right? We have different metaphors, we have different ways of learning. But essentially what you're bringing up here is the hope that AI systems can truly be personalized, and that personalization is going to lead to something. So with that, I'm going to use that, too. You brought up that personalization is one place that you're focused on right now. You're heading out. Okay, Wenchi, thanks for coming. Thank you. Yeah, it's 238. Yeah, just like Wenchi did. If you need to go, it's no big deal. Please, we appreciate you being here. Can you just talk about what? I sometimes hear people talk about personalization as, like, we're hoping for it. We're hoping that it will be great. But what do you see as the reality? Maybe not today, but how does chat GPT, the ability to context set, maybe the ability to fine tune based on my own data. How does that relate to personalization here?
Speaker A: So I think I just set this context with some references to stuff I've read in the science fiction. I'll refer to two specific books that I recommend you guys pick up when you have the time. One is AI 2041 by Typhoon. And it's an amazing exploration of where AI can play a role across different sort of situations. And then the end of every short story is broken down into sort of a technical deep dive. What tools, what's happening today? What direction is it going in in the future? And there's a bunch of stories that actually talk about what you just asked, and specifically around education as well. The second book is a book called Project Hieroglyph, and this is from the University of Arizona. You won't find it on Amazon or Goodreads, as I just found out. But if you just search for Project Hieroglyph, you will find it on Google. You have to buy it from their website. It's got at least three stories that talk about education and in a word, of generally dystopian science fiction. These are very utopian sort of thought experiments about what learning could really look like in the future. Now coming down. So a lot of what I am sort of exploring right now is a derivative of what I'm picking up from many of these kinds of stories. And I'm very curious about the goals that you're also working towards, because in some sense, some of us might be familiar with the idea of knowledge graphs already being sort of developed for different types of users. With Generative AI, you can just be so much more precise about that kind of information, and that can inform curiosity discovery for someone to learn to identify. And I think the general direction that we are seeing today, the pace with which it's evolving, we are already seeing these personalized agents of sorts. People are experimenting with this idea about embedding an agent on a person's graph and then enabling them to be able to discover and identify and then potentially learn from different sources. Now, in some sense, I'm looking at this from the point of view of commerce and fulfilling needs that people need. People have, and largely, I feel like, and you pointed it out nicely, which is this curiosity angle and the discovery out of that curiosity, that's something that can actually be brought about with what's happening today.
Speaker B: Have people found, like, I have found that the personalization already without is amazing, even with these generic systems. Right. I can go on and say, explain this to me. It starts off, and I'd be like, actually that was too low level. Actually, I have a PhD in psychology. Can you explain to me as you would for someone with my kind of background? And it's like, oh sure, I can try that. It's like, okay, that was too mathematical. And you bring up the dialogue method of learning, which just seems so much more natural, which has been unlocked now. And maybe that's a different path towards personalization than being automatically given the best lecture for you based on training data. By following you over your whole life, it's allowing you to agentically work with the system.
Speaker D: Have you tried Kamigo's AI? It's a Khan Academy. Yeah, Khan Academy called Kamigo. It's already doing all of the things that we're saying. So basically if you say a kid is like, hey, why do I need to learn algebra? It's like, hey, what is your favorite subject? Or what's your favorite activity? He says soccer. And then it makes it relevant to, this is why you need to, because you want to understand a soccer game, blah, blah.
Speaker A: The context is, yeah.
Speaker D: So it makes it relevant, inclusive and engaging.
Speaker B: Do we know how well that's working so far?
Speaker D: Sounds like from what we've seen or analyzed, it works pretty well and it really taps into the intrinsic motivation part of learning.
Speaker A: So I think where that's missing and I think eventually everyone's going to get there is understanding the larger context of every human. Where are they moving around? What's their general sort of vicinity? Like, where are they learning from? What are they learning? What are their interests? And then taking that context and then putting it as a part of this dialogue.
Speaker D: Yeah. In this industry, we call it the digital twin of the learner. Right? So if you create a digital twin from five years old, then that digital twin follows you around and it takes the classroom learning integrates with your family, trip to France or whatever. Right? So that has a repository as our neon cortex at all times.
Speaker B: Totally, yeah, yeah.
Speaker D: I love that idea. And I saw the initial article about it and I think that that would be extremely beneficial to the K twelve education system because I think we've all heard like, teachers are overworked and there's so many things that teachers have to do in a day and to take away some of that work and make it more efficient so that they can actually do the things that builds the community and builds them as amazing human beings in society would be incredible. Right? I think a lot of teachers, they just want the best for the kids. So it's not necessarily they want to teach them how to do a certain math problem. It's more of they want to make sure the student is growing.
Speaker B: Imagine in this reverse classroom where you do lectures at home and you come in. One thing that sometimes fails in that method is that people don't do the lectures at home and they don't read. But what if Camigo, however, wasn't just supportive all the time, but could be disappointed? You are working with Camigo over. It's actually the tutor that Varun is saying. I'm not getting another Camigo. Like, Camigo is never going to be mean to me. Camigo is always supportive, but Camigo knows me and can be disappointed.
Speaker D: That's like the Owl from Duolingo, right? It's like, oh, you didn't keep up your street. The owl is.
Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. But I'm like, it's going to take me. You don't understand. Camigo has seen me through so many things, and I just don't want to disappoint. Anyway, I feel like that.
Speaker D: So you're onto something. This is the intersection between education and therapy. So the concept of ideal parent or ideal educator is someone who is serving that role currently in our lives. Who mom will bring up pictures from three years ago. Remember when, before you had this downturn of emotions about your current situation? This is where you are, and this is how you got here. And there's storytellers in each one of our families or community that serve that role of documentation that does not need to be a human. And right now, you're lucky if you have those people in your life. But we don't always have an ideal parent, ideal educator that's looking out for you.
Speaker B: I was at a restaurant yesterday, and the waitress said, do you want this Halumi? We were kind of like, oh, should we get the Halumi? She's like, it's very salty. Some people don't like that. Do you think you're going to like. We're like, we're not real sure. And she's like, I think you guys came in here, like, a few months ago and you thought it was too salty. She remembered for some reason, I wasn't part of you, but this restaurant was this.
Speaker D: Customers. Did you feel cared for?
Speaker B: I both feel cared for. And I was also like, why don't I, every time I pay for a bill, have for me. This is what you ordered already, and this is what you like. Why do I have to be a documenter myself? This should be something that I have access to without worrying. And this is a trivial use of it. Remembering that I shouldn't reorder Halumi at this place because it's salty. But a lot of the things of education relate to these same aspects. Did you want to bring something up? Yeah, for sure. Thanks for pointing that out.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: I've been kind of mulling over how this hyper individualized path learning would really structurally shift the role between technology and human teachers. And I think it's going to shift very differently depending on where you are in the world. I can imagine probably at remote countries where if we think about access to information versus access to intelligence or access to motivation, sort of like how I'm thinking about that. I'm not trained with this professional skills.
Speaker C: But that's how I'm thinking about it.
Speaker B: And I would imagine some remote countries where AI can bring that access to information which, like in the world that we live in, basically everybody has. You type anything Google and you get it. And teachers have traditionally picked up the role of transference of intelligence because a lot of times you read a book and you're like, I don't know what this is talking about. This doesn't make sense to me. And then teachers step in and kind of, sort of bring in the context that will help you absorb material, which is now replaced by AI. So then what do teachers do? And that kind of led me down to thinking, what can teachers do? I think that the discussion format is more common in college. And as you move down the age group in high school and middle school, the teachers probably still carry out the role of transference of knowledge. And then in the early years of K twelve, you have grade one through six. They carry out the transference of discipline because you can't expect like six year olds to sit down and just read and absorb material. That's not reasonable of the child. What I'm really interested is like, okay.
Speaker A: If a child is old enough, like.
Speaker B: They'Re twelve, they're 13, they've had some basic self controlling behavioral regulation capabilities. Then what the teachers do.
Speaker D: I'm curious to Rachel's answer to this. If you're free from knowledge transfer all day, what would you do?
Speaker B: Yeah, I have one thought, and I'd love to hear your thought on it. So my one thought is perhaps the future role of a teacher within that segment is more of a coach. It's the transference of motivation. It's like showing you how to strap Coach Carter.
Speaker C: They lift you up when you're knocked.
Speaker B: Out and when you're getting too full of yourself, they knock you down.
Speaker D: Oftentimes what we talk about in the classroom is that this traditional thought process of there's a teacher, she or he or they are the leader, and all the students are listeners. That model is actually very ineffective to learning. Right. So it's really that the teacher is the facilitator, but the teacher is not the person who gives all the knowledge. So I'm sitting here in my circle, my kids are on the rug, and I'm asking questions like, I have this problem. How do I fix this? I don't know, where should I start? And the kids just start talking. They turn to each other. They're like, oh, what if we did this? What if we did that? And I think having a lot of those would be my preference. In the perfect world of AI, teaching the technical skills. Right. Having them do the problem solving with each other, because they can do problem solving with AI as well. But that human collaboration is super important, especially when you're young. And then my second thought is that there's a lot of research, last studies out there that play is super important for students actually, in any age, really. Just like being able to laugh, do random things, be human and be human. Yeah. And it builds a lot of cognitive skills. So a lot of that is taken away with the pressure, standardized testing, and the material that we have to get through in a year. So I think that's also very important.
Speaker A: The happiest adults are the ones that get to work, but they treat work as play.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker A: Not just in tech.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker A: At least from my life. Everybody that I know who's happy as an adult is happy because they play.
Speaker D: Exactly. Yeah. And there has been a lot of people trying to disrupt this. Like Sage on the stage model. Teaching, like, one most prominent in higher Ed is probably the most popular class by far. Year after year at the Harvard Kennedy School, where people go there to become like their nation leaders. And these things, they bet their entire semester's credit on this class called leadership online. And I don't know if anyone take it or hope you take it, but I'll spoil the first class. I've never taken this, but people show up and the lecturer, who is this famous guy who wrote this whole book, he just sits there. No matter what people do, he just does not say a word for the first two lectures. And the entire class just panics every time. Right. So you have, like 50 people who just doesn't know what is happening. Some people gets angry. Some people get sad. Some people walk out. And then in that chaos, people start to lead in their own way. And then the third class start to unpack how people lead in the absence of leadership. And what does that say about your own leadership skills from where you are? And it's mostly effective way of teaching. Sometimes it's not teach. Yeah, it's often not taught. It's because we have this traditional thought process that there's someone in the front of the room going to tell me what to do, and I'm just going to do what they tell me.
Speaker C: So I have an interesting anecdote here.
Speaker B: Which is, I went to a middle.
Speaker C: Roy, I love that you brought this up. I went to a middle school run by Scientologists and their model of teaching.
Speaker B: We're learning stuff about it.
Speaker C: They had a model of teaching where I was never once given a lecture by a teacher in middle school. It was exactly what we're talking about. All learning was done by reading books yourself. And so they basically just had collections of books, and you learn on your own collections of different types of experiments you can do to learn ideas, like sample course walkthroughs, basically. And at the end of whatever you're doing here, you get a test where you talk to a teacher, they talk about the material. Maybe you do some written problems, if it's like math or something, and then they're like, okay, you know this stuff well, or you don't. And they also tested for mastery. And so if you got things wrong, you have to go back. And it was all self paced. And so I took a year and a half to finish 7th grade and half a year to finish 8th grade. And what was interesting in this system is what is the role of the teacher in this classroom?
Speaker D: Are they present?
Speaker C: Oh, every classroom has a teacher, and these classrooms are like seven, eight people. They're really small. And what's interesting for me is the role of the teacher was like a mentor relationship. I got really close to my teachers. I really liked them. We would talk as friends. I would talk about the stuff I'm learning. They weren't giving me knowledge, but there is this whole sort of social component to at the early point, we were talking education is much more than learning. It might be like social control, but it's also one of your first. It's like a place where you get social relationships from, right. But also teachers were there to figure out what are gaps in your knowledge. They would go to your desk and be like, tell me what you're learning about. And you would have to explain stuff to them. And they could see like, oh, these things aren't quite right. Let me course correct a little bit so there's a lot of nudging and stuff going on, and maybe AI would make that less necessary because books are still not truly personalized. Right. You need to do the work to personalize the information from a book to yourself. Right. But, yeah, it's interesting to just think about that. There have been models of education that are not based on the lecture that have students sort of figure out stuff on their own that have been very successful.
Speaker B: Yeah, that's the thing that sounds like a very curated, fostered environment. And I wonder how the rest of the institutions would have to necessarily catch up to that model.
Speaker D: Catch up or return.
Speaker A: Right. That model there. In Finland right now, there's this popular book called Finnish Lessons by Karberg, who essentially transformed the Finnish education structure. And a lot of it has to do with this kind of approach. Children choose a particular sort of goal or something of interest, and it's almost like a project based approach to figuring out all the things that come together. And there's a teacher who's more of a facilitator. Taking them through.
Speaker D: This is also what we're doing. We're having an informal learning experience right now that would.
Speaker B: Like part.
Speaker A: You mentioned Socrates. I've been thinking about Socrates for a while here, listening to you guys. And also something that was said about the coach kind of knocking you down if you're too full of yourself or it's the thing. You need to be challenged. Right. Sometimes you need to have your worldviews challenged sometimes by someone, then that's like the Socratic dialogue. Also, he's annoying people almost by just asking these really silly questions or what people would think was silly questions. But he's trying to get at something deeper about the nature of society, the nature of the psyche or whatever, right. And get people to think. It's like to start that thinking process, right? Because you need to use your body, you need to use your brain to become smarter and to develop skills, right? And I can have today, I can have machines do most of the things for me, right. I don't actually need to use my body that much, but I'll become sick.
Speaker B: I feel like AI systems, you can imagine, I think already an AI system prompted, well, that could do a pretty good job at this kind of facilitation. And yet this is a guess. I'm guessing it wouldn't do that. It wouldn't cause the kind of results we'd want. And I'm wondering if that's because we don't feel a sense of accountability to the AI system. I'm also trying to think about, like, if you're coordinating amongst, let's say there's seven people that could be doing different things. Maybe one role of a teacher is to just say, if you've ever had the experience of saying, where should we go to dinner? And everyone doesn't say anything, and then someone can just say like, I think Japanese. And everyone just is like, yeah, that sounds good. And it's helpful to have someone take on that leadership role so that everyone could find something better. But if we were in a group and then an AI system said, how about Japanese? I'm not sure if we would all get in line around that. We might be like, our text message just said Japanese, should we do that? And so I wonder what is the somewhat, almost vestigial set of accountability we feel to a human? And is that going to be critical to the role or are we going to be able to have a lot of these facilitated benefits that we've talked about through AI systems?
Speaker D: We can have AI teachers or no AI teachers.
Speaker B: Well, I'm saying like, a lot of the things that are brought up here are pointing out that education.
Speaker A: No problem.
Speaker B: Thanks for coming, Jesse. Yeah, it's 03:00 look, let's just take a moment. Actually, if anyone else needs to leave, please get up now. Roy, thank you for coming. Please. If you see themes in the future and are interested to sign up again, we love seeing people return. May take care for the people that are still here.
Speaker A: Is it just us?
Speaker B: Do we want to, like we can say, what I'm trying to get us to think about a little bit right now is people have brought up, okay, direct knowledge transfer or a system that knows a bunch of things is not sufficient for education. Right. We need good facilitation, good questioning, push sometimes. And there's nothing about that that seems outside of an AI model's capabilities. Potentially assuming that we imbue it with the responsibility and accountability that we feel there's something there. And so do people agree? Does it seem like an AI system could be a good facilitator or do all these things that we're talking about? And if so, what is the role of teacher, human teachers within that world? Whoever wants to jump in?
Speaker E: Yeah, I think a couple of preliminary issues before this. I think the role of an AI teacher also becomes contextually very different in different situations. So I have worked on just studying different policies and working on an education policy for a member country. So I have been aware of the Finnish policies, how education system is in Singapore, how it's in us and more centralized versus decentralized. That's a broader idea, where in some countries the model works, where you don't have regularized testing patterns, while some countries have it inherently in the policy. Now, I like the discussion where there is this idea of, let's say, education being more freelanced, more free thinking, and people having the idea to choose certain narratives. But I also feel that with the broader context of the country, the socioeconomic status, I think that also becomes important where what are the right interventions? Are people able to think freely or not? And are they at the right stage to have that kind of intervention? Or it's like these systems can also be like a little haywired. So my point is stemming from the fact that with an AI system, you have an infinite knowledge access, and if you don't know how to search or how to understand, how to traverse that knowledge, it can be extremely detrimental to you than, let's say, a human teacher, or how a path by path or step by step information partly would come for you.
Speaker A: Which I guess brings up the question. And I really love that idea. The idea, the story about the guy just sitting there in the classroom and staring at people. How do you initialize the mind state of the learner at any given moment? Testing, maybe, but I'm very strong test all the time. What a great tutor does is they're just looking at you. And let's say if it's a language tutor, they don't necessarily test you. But when you speak that language, they pick it up certain things and they form a belief state about what you currently know, what you don't. And the language is just the obvious example, are probably less obvious ones as well. Like if you are, for example, learning Calc three, but somewhere in Calc one, you didn't understand the concept. All I will see, even as a human tutor, is that you're struggling with this problem in Calc three. And I will really need to dig deep into the layers of that problem solve if you realize that, oh, there's this one concept that apparently you got a little bit wrong and something in your mental internal representations does not align with what we actually know calculus is. So how do you figure that out? Leadership skills. How do you figure out what sort of leader somebody is? No test can help you. Not even looking at somebody, just do one problem will help you. You have to actually wait for a few lectures to figure it out.
Speaker C: So I love this idea of initializing the mind state of the learner. What a good sentence by the way. One thing, though, that I've recognized from having mentors or professors or teachers that inspire me to learn more is a certain desire to be like them. There's like an aspirational quality to this relationship where I see this person and I'm like, I want to do what they're doing, right? I want to think in the way that they're thinking. And I do think that this could be a potential wrinkle in this relationship with AI, which is that fundamentally, this isn't a person. This is maybe at best a robot, right. But this sense of, like, I want to be you and become like you isn't really present in that relationship. It's probably more of like, you are this thing that is this repository of all this information. And you can tell, I don't know, it feels different.
Speaker A: Why do you want that? Why do you want to be like them?
Speaker C: That's a good.
Speaker A: I mean, go ahead. As an anthropologist, I'm just going to say that humans are fundamentally like relational creatures, right? We relate to each other. That's just kind of hardwired into us. So I guess that's like, we mirror other people, and when we see people we admire, I think we want to mirror them. But I was thinking just to kind of like, oh, maybe AI can't take that role, but we have non humans or other than human entities that people have had relationships with or had aspirational. Just looking at religion, right. You can have kind of an admiration for something that is not human or.
Speaker B: A character, literally any character in film, while they're not human, they're a character With a human on top of it. People can be like, man, I want.
Speaker A: To be like whoever said Lion King?
Speaker B: Yeah, I want to be so wise.
Speaker A: But maybe it will be a problem. But maybe it won't be a problem. I don't like, will we all look up to AI?
Speaker B: Maybe your AI, maybe your AI will be customized for you to look up to them.
Speaker D: Yeah. I feel like that human connection is more important than we think. If we look at how students gravitate towards different types of teachers, there's a lot of conversation about how we need more black and brown teachers in the classroom because that supports. They see them as like, oh, wow, this is something I can aspire to. This is someone who I really admire, and it's not someone all my other teachers are someone that doesn't look like me. And there's huge differences in the way that they engage in school. So I think for AI, it's similar where they don't see themselves in them. And so they see them as very technical and very good at what they're teaching, but they're not modeling what they're going to do as strongly as if a human modeled that experience.
Speaker B: When we were talking about Calc two and calc three, that actually brought up something for me. Right now we have standardized curriculum that we go through. And part of that, I'm guessing, is some state based assumption about what's important to learn. But I think part of it is also a way to deal with scale. Right? You're just like, here is a strategy. If we believe that what we really need out of our, from the state level, from K through twelve is critical thinking skills, your ability to adapt to new things. Maybe we really don't need everyone to learn whatever the standardized curriculum is. And what would be better is for every student in the way that maybe you had during your Scientology days, just found a way to have the learner practice the muscles of learning and critical thinking and whatever. And it can be in some very niche world. Maybe this kid is really into New Age agriculture or something. I don't know. It doesn't matter. It doesn't have to be necessarily part of a curriculum yet. We can have more generalized teachers who aren't like, I didn't learn to be England English teacher. I learned to support kids, be critical thinkers through whatever they're interested in. And we don't have to necessarily wait till college or after college for kids to start doing that. They could probably start doing that when they're six.
Speaker D: Yeah, they should be. Yeah, critical thinking, all those cognitive skills should be learned as early as possible.
Speaker A: Because I was thinking about when I was doing like pedagogical and they were talking about my professors, my teachers were talking about how, yeah, this critical thinking, we need to, children need to learn how to learn and stuff like that. It's less important that they are like a receptacle of just random knowledge of Norwegian history. But that's also like answering. I saw that as also like you're trying to answer the needs of the economy, like a new emerging economy where you need people to be flexible, you need people to kind of change around or to move around in different roles and stuff like that. But it's very liberating for the individual. Yeah, it's like answering the needs of the economy, but it also like having those skills are also aligned with kind.
Speaker B: Of like self actualization.
Speaker A: Yeah. So it's not a bad thing. But I was thinking that education is still about serving state needs, serving economic needs, but then suddenly it's also path for individual liberation in a sense. Also now I don't know where it was.
Speaker B: I just think.
Speaker A: If it's getting more alignment, it's good. Yeah, I guess you could say it's getting better.
Speaker B: I imagine you can have an AI system that let's say your student was really getting into. They were like, you know, what really inspires me is 3D printing weapons at home. And they start kind of pursuing that. I think we can have an AI system that probably nudges the student away from that particular pathway of engaging, but yet still finds one where their feeling of education feels like play. Like we've been talking about before and they don't realize it, but they're really becoming a more critical thinker that's going to give them more optionality later in life. They're going to be able to continuously learn and become more self actualized. They'll be more useful for the state. All of these things don't need to be your top of mind to be a beneficial outcome. But I don't know, does anyone want to play the other side? That a standardized curriculum isn't just a convenience structure, but has benefit you? Chicago person, do you want to answer?
Speaker F: Well, I mean, it's not just about teaching people things. It's about assessing relative competencies that we use to award positions of responsibility in society. And it's the performance on these standardized tests and so forth that we usually use to say this person should get the research fellowship or the PhD stipend or the whatever or the job and so forth. So it's like part of it. We use education structures not just to teach people things and socialize them, but to sort them into what we think of as appropriate places in the world. That would be like the argument for you want to make sure there's regularity and uniformity in the content people are being delivered and in the style of being delivered. So you can see how they compete on a level playing field in some way.
Speaker B: You want to get at their like you control as much as possible so that you can get at that underlying.
Speaker F: Yeah, everyone had the same textbook, everyone had the same lecture, everyone has the same test, and who's able to best make sense of the things they were told and use them to critically think and answer questions. Now you could think of a more complicated way of getting there, which people do have individualized learning paths that somehow still hit the key requirements of the curriculum being taught, and then they're able to all perform to the best of their ability. But part of this is people are regularly faced with standardized situations that are not adapted to their individual needs. And part of this is learning to overcome that. And I may be a visual learner, but now I'm going to work with people who are verbal. And so I can't expect the world to conform to my preferences totally.
Speaker B: I think also another aspect, from your first point about socializing people to be part of a society, I thought another aspect you would bring up is having some common framework. It's probably not useful to be part of a global stage to know Norwegian history, but it might be useful to be part of Norwegian society to know some Norwegian history. And that's useful. Yeah.
Speaker E: I think fundamentally, if we see a lot of these profound thinkers like Socrates or Dawan Shi, these are people who have specialized in across interdisciplinary fields, like they have studied philosophy, they have studied science, they have studied astronomy. So I think a lot of standardized education also takes a leave where the student is exposed to certain subjects according to their liking or disliking. Because I think how, just like you mentioned right now, that in certain times the world won't conform to how the situation is around me. And I think in this manner, even if, let's say it's like a little non interesting to the student, but still prepares him in more rounded ways or in ways to understand situations better.
Speaker B: Yeah, I want to just separate two. One is a standardized curriculum, and the other, which I think has been conflated a little bit on the other side, is not necessarily do whatever the student wants. You might have certain objectives of depth and breadth, of adaptability. You might have a quite complicated set of goals for your specialized curriculum that aren't just follow the student wherever they want to go. So I just want to set, there's like whether that standard, which has some purpose potentially like the measurement against a standard benchmark or something like that, versus the. I take your point. It's a reasonable point that I don't think we want to dive. Yeah, they're just, you might want know. Think about the great tutor. What would the great tutor.
Speaker C: I'll add like a third thing and then talk a little bit about Andrew's criticism of standardization and the way that that relates to teaching for tests or teaching for these markers of. You passed this thing, so you can now be incorporating society in this way or whatever. So there is this benefit of being socialized in a similar way as you bring up that I think is really important. I should know about American history. I was not interested in it in high school. But it's important that I did learn it to be able to understand current events. It's also important that you should study broadly because your ability to derive creative insights might depend on pulling different pieces from different domains and synthesizing them together. Right. And then the third thing is about discovery. And this is maybe similar to filter bubble arguments about social media, where Twitter will put you in a filter bubble where you're exposed to just the same kind of thing and you're not exposed to different types of domains or thoughts or ideas potentially. I think that there is a similar worry about an AI tutor that is like, okay, this is what Brew wants to learn. I'll just help him learn this thing more and more and more. I went to a school, a college with a great books curriculum basically where I had to learn about anthropology and sociology. And I came in basically want to study philosophy. And I came out being like anthropology and sociology have much to bear on the questions that I'm interested in. And I would have never been exposed to those things had that not been a part of the curriculum.
Speaker B: Right?
Speaker C: And so I think you're right. There's not just standardization and this is the set of information that everyone wants to should know, but also standardization in terms of these are things that everybody should learn about. How deep I go into each one of those, what I maintain a surface level understanding of, maybe that's up to the person. But broad exposure, I think is very good for people and learners, especially when tHey're young, know very little about themselves. There is this spiritual component to education as we're talking about. And part of that is broad exposure, like seeing and learning about yourself in different places in different ways, like interacting with different curriculums. I think that is really critical and we would want to preserve that.
Speaker A: So in the general sense, I kind of agree. But when we think about the most specialized, when someone chooses a particular stem field, that's where I think standardization to a great degree must apply. If you're going to train to be an astronaut, these are some standards you absolutely need to understand and follow. If you're going to be working in a certain type of lab environment, you need to follow those standards. And I guess if they're going to be. And that's where I don't know how this structure can be brought in or how AI can ensure that this structure is followed.
Speaker B: Maybe I can give a little bit just on standardized testing, which is there are two different kinds of standardized tests that people will, that sometimes get completed. One is like, you need to know certain things like a licensing exam. And I need to make sure that you know those things. What I'm testing you is exactly the things that I care about. It's like a certificate, another kind of test. You don't actually care really about those questions. Those questions are there for us to estimate some unseen variable, which is like math knowledge or college adequacy or intelligence, whatever. And so there, when you're testing someone like a computer scientist, this is in Silicon Valley, like the data structure and algorithms tests that people do before you go get a job at Google, sometimes there's a criticism of them. Like, I don't make use of link lists. I don't make use of rebalanced trees. That doesn't matter to some degree because it's not actually testing link list because you're using link list. It's testing it because link lists seem to be predictive of a whole bunch of other things. In terms of how good a computer scientist you are, a program you are, we can question whether there's actually a relationship, but that's the point there. And so these are very different uses of tests, and they have different purposes. And if your estimate of some underlying skill, it actually ends up becoming a measure of something else. Like, for instance, can you speak English fluently instead of computer science, which most of our standardized tests are implicitly also a test of English understanding, then you're going to get a bad signal. So Andrew's point about if you do other have a very unique education, then it's possible that when you get to that standardized test, it's reflecting something that the test designers didn't anticipate. It's reflecting the fact that you didn't read this set of books, which are actually irrelevant, but happen to be the things that anyone who's educated does. And so it is difficult separating education and testing.
Speaker F: This is a really interesting dovetail of another thing, which is in admissions, right? And there are certain kinds of activities that we think have higher value than others on a person's admissions profile. And it comes down to the kinds of books or kind of literary influences or how they talk and all these things.
Speaker B: Right.
Speaker F: On this component of, like, how do you divert people according to aptitudes into whether some environments, like STEM and super agree people need subject matter expertise and reasoning skills? Those are two different things. We need them both. So in Ender's game, there's the Giant cup, right? Which is a game that anyone familiar.
Speaker A: With the story Ender's game.
Speaker F: Okay, so the quick gist is kids are being trained to lead space armies. Okay, that's the gist. And they're trying to figure out who's the smartest kid. And so they have this game they all play in their free time, which the kids think is a game, but really what it's doing is this extended psych evaluation and to figure out who has the killer instinct and all this kind of stuff. And it's super interesting. I know one thing that's contentious. So whether we highly segment people into professions that they have highest aptitude to is something that Germany does right from a very early age, streaming people into. And it's like this middle school doesn't lead to university, it leads to a technical college.
Speaker A: We have that in Norway as well, to some degree, actually.
Speaker F: Right? And it's one of these things where it's like you're trying to optimize for social positive outcomes through the allocation of scarce resources. You're not optimizing for individual liberty, individual freedom and self exploration because you're intentionally curtailing people's options based on very early assessments of their aptitudes and interests.
Speaker B: You could be optimizing. It could. In a certain world, it could be that you're also optimizing at the same time for the state's benefit, for human flourishing, because those early signals are so good at recognizing where you will thrive in the future. I think that's not true. But you could imagine that while you're not optimizing for human freedom and agency, you are still leading to the person ending up in a place where they would thrive.
Speaker A: Just add something in here. Yeah. Because I come across this back home where it's like there's talk about, oh, we're mass producing master's degrees and everyone has to go through university level education where at middle school and high school, you kind of go for what we call study preparation studies, or the school that will lead you to a university. But you can, at some point, I think in middle school, you can go for practical, you can go to practical school where you become an electrician or et cetera. Right? And there's like this, there are debates where it's like, oh, we need more people to go to practical school. And they would probably maybe be more happy if they went to practical school, because the argument is they're not happy with the master's degree and they're not finding it useful to have a master's degree. And society doesn't need everyone to have a master'S degree.
Speaker F: Right.
Speaker A: Which is all kind of economic arguments, but they also kind of touch on like if you find yourself in a situation where you're overly educated and you can't make use of that, you're going to suffer in a way.
Speaker B: Yeah, potentially.
Speaker A: Potentially, right. But even so, as a person who's doing a PhD and has gone through a lot of education, right, I want to defend.
Speaker B: You will suffer.
Speaker A: Yeah, I will suffer immensely, but I want to defend the virtue of just going through education because I see it as having been very beneficial to me. Right. But I also fully understand the people are like, oh, I went through five years of doing anthropology in university and now what?
Speaker B: Well maybe one way, one. We've talked about AI potentially democratizing and lowering the cost so it won't be such a big, you won't feel like this know, certainly money and time. I also want to bring this to Varun. Early on you were talking about continued education and what I heard you talk about a little bit with discovering what you're into. And the UChicago Great books I'm bringing to a reinforcement learning concept called Explore Exploit Trade Offs, which is if you're in a constant environment, there's unbeknownst to a learner, some optimal learning rate where you're able to, for a while think about this is often talked about in terms of multi arm bandits, lottery machines with lots of slots. Now if you pull one and you get a reward, you win. Should you continue pulling that one forever? Let's say you pull it again it gives you a win, you pull it again, it gives you a loss. Now what do you do? Do you pull it again? Gave two out of three maybe that's good and you keep doing it unless they're 66% and you've just only pulled that one. That's one way. But there was this other one over here that gives rewards 100% of the time and whatever. And so this is a policy making, decision making strategy. How much do you explore? How much do you exploit? And there's often this period of exploration that then turns into a period of exploitation that's in a constant world. If the world is changing or you're changing, then you might need renewed periods of heightened exploration. And right now I feel like we generally, at least our institutions are an exploration kind of high for a while and then eventually you hit exploitation. And we all know that decades ago people would stay in one career for much longer than today, right? We're in a time where people are switching careers more often and I see that as both. I mean maybe that's a representative of more chaos, but also probably of more agency. We're able to actually think of other places where we can go and map a trajectory from where we are to some other area that better conforms to society's needs today. And my own interests. I was a psychologist for a decade, now I work in AI governance. Like that's a different world that has been allowed by access to the Internet, a feeling of constant learning, an ability to constantly all of these kinds of things. And so I just want to bring that up to say that even the concept of when we educate is based on a scarcity and difficulty in allowing people to continuously explore. And I'm not sure if it does as many benefits in the long run to hyper connect this continuous learning with taking a pause from being a productive member of the working world and entering into a master's program or PhD. These things can be made more continuously whole. And I think we see that amongst we're the early adopters, I think, and I hope that this can be a tool that allows people to never stop know.
Speaker F: Education doesn't quench a thirst that lights a fire.
Speaker B: Is that Andrew or is that the.
Speaker F: Quote from Thomas Coinas?
Speaker B: I think, yeah, I like that. A.
Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. No, I actually loved what you just said. The way that we structured it is there's this time in your life where you learn a bunch of stuff and then you figure out how to use that stuff that you've learned and that's it, right? There's this sort of clean separation between my state as a learner, my state as a doer, right? What is interesting to me, theOretically, is that how both of these activities are quite intertwined, right? I've learned a lot on the job, right? I've been in this period in my life where I'm supposed to exploit the knowledge that I have. I've been learning a lot. And part of this is in order to exploit or more, or something like that, right? I have to learn a lot more new technical skills to do these projects at work that have taught me new sorts of things. But I guess what I struggle with is when I'm out in the real world, I'm also trying to figure out these questions of what do I want to learn, what do I want to become, what do I want to. These are unknowns that I am figuring out, right? And an AI agent, I don't know if it's going to know those things, right? Those are things that come out from my interactions with the world.
Speaker B: Sure. I mean, this is going back to Jerslav's point about defining the benefit of defining the important problems in whatever space important being helps you direct yourself and it helps give intentionality. Like some of you I've talked to, I was more and still am interested and involved in the effective altruism space. And one of the things that effective altruism definitely does is try to explicitly say, what are the important problems? And you should go do your work in that. And that is a helpful framing device to where I should focus my learning. It gives meaning. And that's like clearly a relevant thing at any level, whether it's the most important problems or just you're like, what are the important open questions in oil painting? And you're like trying to engage with oil painting. And so you have to do your work to be like, what have people done before? And what is there to explore?
Speaker C: But I think the way that I will maybe frame this problem is to go back to this analogy of having this private tutor since the age of five, right? There comes this point, maybe when you're like 23 or 24 and you go to your mentor and you're like, okay, I've learned all these things. I'm doing this work. What now? What happens? And Maybe there's this point where this mentor says, I have some ideas, but you have to figure this out on your own. This is the end of what I can contribute to your life. It's now your space to figure out what knowledge is valuable, what things are valuable for me to be working on. And maybe it's helpful if I could go to a website and be like, what is the most impactful thing? Pick number one. Do that. Right. But I think the vision here is there's this point where even this other person that knows much more than you is much wiser than you has this moment where they're like, this is the limits of what I can offer you, and it's time for you to be in this state in your life where you figure this out for yourself. And I guess I'm curious. I'm sure that we're going to. I face those tensions with chat TBT right now. For example, it's like one of the things that I brought up when moving around in a circle, which is like, I ask it a bunch of technical questions, it gives me back some answers. And there are probably points where I should have been like, okay, I should figure this out on my own. I don't need you. Right? And, and so I guess, like this is going back to if there is this agent that has known me in this very personal way. There also needs a point. I think it needs a good theory of when it should be present for me and when it shouldn't be present for me, when I should be figuring out these things on my own and when I shouldn't.
Speaker F: On that point, another Sci-Fi reference. For anyone interested in the series Dune. There's this event called the Butlerian Jihad, right? Where the humans rise up and defeat the machines. Why do they do that? Because humans had been rendered so incompetent, so incapable of independent thought, that they were basically just like meatbags. And I think I remember in elementary school, one of the skills you learn is how to do research, right? Like how to go to the library and look for stuff on your own. And so if you have this, I mean, this is like you're preempting that skill being developed. If your omni tutor just feeds you, spoon feeds you everything just the way you like it, whatever. You don't learn to hunt, right?
Speaker B: Yeah, but maybe the learning to hunt is like the equivalent of knowing which way is north all the time. In a place where, I don't know, I thought it was a pretty important skill to learn how to read a paper. And that was still a skill for graduate students where it's like, what's the point here? We're going to learn this topic, but really what we're learning is how do you read a paper? And will that be a relevant skill? Sorry, party.
Speaker A: No. When new technologies are introduced, it's going to be a very marshmallow glue and take. It does kind of atrophy some skills, but it also leads to other abilities. So I bring this up a bunch of times, I guess, like, writing kind of lets us put our thoughts down and then kind of weakens our ability to remember things. Right. But there's only so much orally transmitting something can do for you. Right. It lets us extend ourselves even further. Right. And then you don't actually need to know how to remember things like they used to before because you don't need it. You can go and look it up.
Speaker B: I think this move to using chat TPT is if any of you have moved from being an IC to a manager, at some point, you move from like, what is the level of detail I need to have in this topic such that I can actually direct and understand what's happening in this person, what work they're doing, so I can contextualize it into the larger goals that I have. And when you're a manager, it's not necessarily your goals. Maybe you're trying to reflect the company's goals or something like that. But I kind of feel like that's the relationship we'll start to have with more and more powerful systems where you're like, am I learning all these things? It's like you're not. And just like when you become a manager, your IC skills do atrophy and they're not being kept up, but you gain something more, which is now what I am able to do is what my five members of my team do. And you can be good at that or bad. Like, if you're micromanaging each of those, you're going to not do that much as a manager. And I think that might be the same as what we're going to see each person develop over their army of knowledge robots.
Speaker A: Actually, I have a question that is more like on the practical level, because I've been wondering, how do I actually implement large language models into my future teaching right now as they are now? How could I use those systems to benefit me and the students?
Speaker F: Right?
Speaker A: I don't know yet. I was thinking could use some kind of augmented retrieval kind of thing, where it's like, instead of sending an email to ask about the curriculum, they could just go to this thing and get an answer from that, because there's a lot of questions that are just repeat questions. And that can be really exhausting for a lecturer to go through those questions again and again and again. Have you actually looked at the syllabus? Right, so more of an interactive syllabus thing. It was like, that's the first thing that popped into my head. But I'm sure that people have way more creative ideas than I do. In some sense. The first order effect of this is that they can ask questions about the curriculum. And the Second order Effect is that maybe now you have two more hours a week where you're not answering those questions. It's like, what can you do as a teacher in those 2 hours? Maybe you can actually reach out to somebody who you felt like was too quiet in the class and be like, hey, is everything going okay? And you can do things as a teacher that you couldn't do before. So you're not actually using the language model to, let's say, help out that one person who's struggling, but because you now have more time, you can do that.
Speaker F: I think also on the student expectation side, like their ability to Consume Information and synthesize, it, is much greater than ever before. In the mid 19 hundreds, there was this big controversy in High jump, because pole vault because the poles went from wood to fiberglass, and now all These records were shattered.
Speaker B: Right.
Speaker F: You got to raise the bar.
Speaker D: I don't know.
Speaker B: So we're at 335, we end it officially at four, but I'd like to start winding this down a little bit. And it's been a great discussion. I've really enjoyed. I hope you have had a great discussion or can take some. Some things away with you. The way we like to end these is just to share your takeaways. Doesn't even have to be a whole takeaway. Was there a single thing that maybe you thought weren't and weren't able to share yet, or something that someone said that has stuck with you? Not everyone has to speak, but just if something comes up to you, we'd love to hear it. Now.
Speaker A: I like the idea of initialization, which is, I think, going to be helpful for what I'm building as well. I like your point specifically about wanting to. Where do we start? Yeah, so the way I've been thinking about it is in my products case, it's largely around the commerce experience. And I think it could be useful to. How you're thinking about this as well is that there's a system of record kind of inventory. There's stuff that's available, accessible to everyone in a class, and then there's the evidence, which is sort of specific to each student. When you think of the LLMs today, it's pretty easy to build out an LLM that focuses on what's common inventory. It's not so easy to identify something that's specific, and I'm not technical in this, but I believe the way in which we are going to evolve in this direction is to have the system of record and a smaller. If you've read about baby GPT, these small little models that can engage at a local level, you will have to potentially integrate some sort of an architecture that connects in all of these three, four elements and one that perhaps becomes like your dashboard. As a teacher, what do you get to see? What do you get to query?
Speaker B: Just build a teacher app for yourself. Should take you an afternoon using GPT and then come back to us.
Speaker A: Actually, that would be super cool. I would love to try that. How do I do it?
Speaker B: I think if you try to make. If you did try to make yourself a little web app, that web app probably wouldn't be a good web app, but you would learn a lot about. And you'll feel powerful because you're like, I didn't know how to do any of this.
Speaker A: And I think even carnival does. I think it's evolving in that direction, so definitely worth exploring.
Speaker B: Yeah. Anyone else? Any other takeaways?
Speaker A: Is there a personality that a teacher language model should have? And if so, how is their personality different from what personality language models have now?
Speaker B: Different language models today have different language.
Speaker A: Different personalities, for one. Right. The current language models are not going to kick your ass if you don't. If you don't study, there's just still going to be nice to you.
Speaker B: I mean, as soon as we get gifts in so that they write something and then they just post some disappointed or whatever, I think that would really up the level of emotional relationship people have with these things. If they were like, emojiing at you and stuff, you'd be like, what is.
Speaker E: Happening here in the Transformers movie Bumblebee? Because he can't speak. He plays the right audio in the radio for us to.
Speaker A: To.
Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I don't know what I think one.
Speaker F: Thing that's come up in my mind is, so school has this really important role of socializing people, and that's not just teacher to student, but student to student. And that's a lot of work. I know I learned a lot of my collaboration and problem solving skills. And so if there is, again, this omni tutor that's always there to help you, do you actually short circuit some of that important type of student to student peer learning and socializing?
Speaker B: What if you, like, cut. Sometimes teachers today are like, what are we going to do about GPT? And they're like, well, maybe we'll have them write essays without their laptop anymore. They're trying to figure out how to do it because they're like, there is something that we want to make part of the curriculum, maybe the grading or whatever else, or practicing certain skills and technology seems to be getting in the way. And I wonder if, again, the inverse classroom kind of thing could force this, which is like, we're going to spend some time in class interacting like this. None of us. We don't have laptops here. None of us. We all understood that having a notebook fit the vibe. And that's not because we are maximally coming to the best ideas in this way. Right? We could have come up with better ideas with technology, but that wasn't the point of this couple of hours right now. And so maybe you just have to be like, this time in school is practicing using your brain muscle.
Speaker D: And that's the suggestion that a lot of articles are saying in terms of educating teachers on how to work with chat GPT and not try to work against it is to allow them to explore different ideas through chat GPT and also providing that time in classroom to have Socratic seminars and to have that discussion to show why that's important, that you still need this component in your life.
Speaker C: This reminds me of similar critiques of how the Internet would affect education, where it's like, wouldn't you just Google search the best ideas on this and present those? And maybe some people do that for essays or for math. Wouldn't you just go to Wolfram Alpha and get it to do all your math and work? I've definitely done that at. But like, then there are these moments in school where you have to take standardized tests where phones are not allowed or not standardized, just like tests, for example. Right? Phones are not allowed or the Internet's not allowed. Or you have these seminars where people aren't typing away on Google, they need to do what we're doing right now. You have these spaces where that technology is not present and you aren't working on those skills.
Speaker B: Yeah, maybe in the think pair share kind of way of teaching, the think part might make use of maybe like we've talked about a little bit, maybe that leads to us thinking worse. But another perspective is if you're not learning how to think with chat GPT, you are not going to keep up. Right? It's a real tool that you need to be able to think with. But the pair share part is the way where you will hopefully be slightly embarrassed if you recognize, wait, you'll get this feedback, right? You'll be like, wait, I didn't actually learn anything. I'm not able to talk here, and you won't want that. Won't feel good. You're pairing with someone else. You weren't able to say anything useful to them. And so you're given not just tests, but a faster iteration to see there are many opportunities in my life. And then if you're an educator, you can say, when will this come up? It's like every time you're at a cocktail party and you need to show off to other people in subtle ways that you are very smart. That's actually an important part of social cachet, and that's what you're doing now.
Speaker C: That should be your pitch about the AI.
Speaker B: Do you want to practice your cocktail party? Showing off.
Speaker A: Education doesn't quench your thirst. On the one hand, build a painkiller, not a vitamin. It's the startup mode. How do we build startups in education?
Speaker F: Yeah, it's a good question. Well, I'll just pose this one thought and really try to you, but the first wave of large ed tech companies have largely not reached their goals. I think like the whole massively online course, I think maybe the cinema there was just educational learning is social and that's what keeps people coming back to it. And so in isolation with the video lecture sucks. Students during COVID I'm sure, had a pretty terrible time with that stuff. So I would definitely want to hear your thoughts on what did go wrong and what could be different.
Speaker A: So I think at the time there was less technology. When I was trying to build that, it was more in person. And how do we bring people from the industry, create that context for these finishing school experiences? So there was less technology. There was an attribute of it which was sort of standardizing their understanding and some expectation. But if we have to look at it right now, and also, to answer your question, part of the reason why I chose commerce to start with is to make money. But there's so much more that can be done with trying to personalize AI for every person. But it was the startup Corona. I have to make money first. You have to be able to do this for the long haul.
Speaker B: I wonder if maybe one of the, I've been talking to one of my direct reports and I'm like, we work in AI governance. AI governance is a fast moving space directly related to AI. And I think for the rest of his life, in his previous work experience, he was able to learn on the job, right? Learn by working. And I'm like, we're recognizing now the projects you're working on are not actually going to be alone, keeping you up as fast as you need to be with the world. Because the goals of our projects we want to do in as easy a way as possible, right? We don't want to just do complicated things for the sake of it. And so in some ways, there's a conflict between my need for him to up level himself continuously, his own desire to do that, to be competitive in the marketplace, and the pragmatic desire to build a product feature as simply as possible that isn't very advanced. And so what that means is I actually have a great desire for my direct reports, my employees, to be continuous learners, and to do so in a way that is meaningfully connected to their work, but is potentially not directly incentivized. And so the classic way that people do that right now is they involve themselves in MOOCs, right? MOOCs are like the educational outlet for like, workers who are trying to continuously learn or you watch YouTube videos, and that is not great. It's not the best way to learn. As we've talked about, it's not great for students. It's definitely not great. I'm currently teaching an AI governance course that another organization set up for people who are like professionals or master's students or whatever, they want to move into AI governance. And this is a nonprofit focused on making this course. They have a curriculum, they have a lot of pre work with a lot of readings and whatever. And then once a week the students come together for a conversation for 2 hours that people like me facilitate. So there they're trying to actually have a better example of a continuous learning approach in this new fast moving field of AI governance or AI safety. And the way they're doing it is a well made curriculum, which is already a benefit. And a lot of expert facilitators, a lot of them like I am scarce resource. And so maybe one place where there actually is, I don't know if this is a vitamin or a painkiller, how much benefit company will get, like someone who will pay, but there's not really a good solution right now for hyper specialized learning, like on demand learning that is better right now than Coursera. Coursera is the high watermark or like YouTube channels. And you think there has to be something better there.
Speaker A: As a people manager, do you have a specific example of when, because you are working, like you said, on the things that are, let's just get this out, let's make it as simple as possible. Let's get it working so that the company can continue operating. What's an example when you then needed somebody to go and learn? Beyond that, if you as a team are working on the simplest things, when does that person need to go and learn more, and why?
Speaker B: So a good reflection of this was in my psychology program. We were working on upgrading our stats and math. And traditionally social psychologists were like the least quantitatively sophisticated. And one of them was asked like, do you feel limited by your current state of statistical knowledge? Basically you say like, are we doing is a course meeting your needs? And one person had a great response which was like, no, I don't feel limited. But I also didn't feel limited when all I knew was a t test, because it was like constraining the scope of my imagined experiments about how I can approach the world because I had this tool set and that bordered mine. And so the way that this is happening in my company is we have certain ways of approaching the AI governance problem. But I am convinced that we don't know enough about, for instance, how generative AI can change the game around how we approach this problem. And the only way that we're going to develop the imagination there is to also be playing with these things continuously and learning more about them. And so it's not necessarily helpful in the near term. But I am personally convinced that if we don't throw some amount of our, it's like the 20% Google time, some amount of our resources into more exploritative, far reaching things, we are going to be navel gazing, essentially. We're going to be just returning to previous solutions to the problem. So that's how I think about it. Cool. Anyone with any last takeaways?
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: Let'S hear both of these and then we'll wrap up. Wrap up after these.
Speaker E: I think one couple of the takeaways, I think thinking about how the entire bachelor's hierarchy of needs and how nation states have viewed education and what active core education is, was extremely enriching. Second, I think a lot of reasons why I feel AI systems and technology in general and the entire first wave of ethics have not been able to disrupt were very critical discussions and takeaways for me, where things like inducing critical thinking or let's say, having extremely personalized methodologies, what is the role of a teacher per se, or an educator or a learner per se in a classroom setting? I think those motivations, those elements also we need to be inculcated in how these tools are presented, because I think we are anyways moving in an information surplus age. So in the end, I think it will boil down to how all of this is best presented to the learner and how much he can grasp and retain. Because in the end, even if, let's say, information is growing at a stupendous age, the pace of our learning and the amount of knowledge which we can hold still remains limited. So even if, let's say, I have a tool where I can go every day and I can ask anything out of the world, my learning will be restricted to certain amount of how much I can consume and how much I can remember.
Speaker B: And this is why humans will be irrelevant soon. Good point. Yeah, I totally agree.
Speaker D: Yeah. I would just like to say I love this conversation. I think with this conversation, I really understand that AI has great potential to being a game changer and a true equalizer to education. And I think one thing that we should continue to be thinking about is who is being forgotten in this conversation as we're continuing to build it up. Right. A lot of times, ed tech startups don't work out is because there's not that conversation between the people who are actually working on it and how that would actually be implemented. And I just think about all the students that may not be thought of, like students with learning differences and students that have a distrust towards technology or have not strong access to technology. Most students do in America, but it varies in the sense of what they do. So I think that's just really important for us to think about as we continue to develop something so that it is an equalizer and not really just making the people who are able to access AI stronger and the students who aren't not.
Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think we really spent time. And that would be the next theme I would like to go through in this conversation on the equity angle because I forget who someone mentioned about access to the Internet or something. Everyone has it. I was speaking to someone working the federal government focused on expanding broadband access because even in the United States, even in San Mateo, there are ten, I think it's like on the tens of millions that don't have dependable Internet access, and that is not AI access or AI knowledge or all the things we're talking about here, that's Internet access in the United States. So clearly, all levels of technology are not available to everyone. Well, cool. Well, thanks everyone. We're going to wrap up here and I think you all already put in your information. When we write up something and post it on Twitter, we'll just tag you all. While this is our primary format, Andrew and I are constantly thinking about ways that we want to improve this or expand it to either the online space or just to more people. If you are interested in running an AI salon, we have a little facilitator's guide. We're happy to support you both in advertising it on our calendar and teaching you, if you need to, a little bit about facilitation, we know each of you probably have your own kind of networks of people that we would love to both bring into these conversation. I'm sure they would love to be part of it. So, yeah, if you would like to facilitate in the future here, let us know. Just reach out. That's it. Thanks everyone.
Speaker D: Thank you.
