Speaker A: Yeah. So, yeah, I just wanted to go around in a circle and just mention like one or two things that are interesting to them or they want to talk about groups and also just like, say your name and we're not going to remember each other's names the first time around, but when you. But cool. So I'm Varun, and part of what's interesting to me about this topic is that I think intellectual endeavors are really important, a fulfilling, happy life. And I'm worried that people outsource a lot of their mental abilities to really powerful AI, and that will lead to a deterioration in a way that will ultimately hurt you in the long run. I feel like I already do this, my memory, which is pretty unique because I can just write things down all the time and I don't know how good that is for me, but I don't know.
Speaker B: Hi, I'm Ronnie, and I was just thinking about this more in the aspect of school and education related to schooling. And I was thinking about how I feel like, the application. I think that students are going to have to focus more on applying concepts rather than learning concepts because learning concepts is going to be, or concepts are going to be so easily accessible that you're going to have to focus more on what you can do after you learn them. So, I mean, that's where I see AI playing into the whole education.
Speaker A: Maybe it'd be a good practice for when you're speaking, just. Is that too weird? Yeah, just because I don't think otherwise, it's probably not going to catch talking stick. How about that? Hi, everyone, my name is Sean. When I was thinking about this during our little silent time, the first thing I thought of, like I was drawing a blank in the beginning. And the first thing I wanted to start with was like, what's the point of learning? What's the point of innovating? What's the point of creating anything, even. And for me, that always starts with something. I think humans only create something or only learn something when they want to achieve something, when they want to do something. I'm just starting with a question, I guess when all the knowledge is accessible to us and every task is able to be done in a click of just like that, then what's the point of even doing if? I think if we answer that question, then maybe we'll figure out what learning, creativity, innovation, post Agi even looks like.
Speaker B: Hi, my name is Annie. She her. I am both a working artist and a hobby artist. So by working artist I am working in the advertising industry. But then I also like to create my own projects on the side. So I think I definitely use chat GPT for work and to write commercial ideas for lunchables or BMW or. So there's a time and place, I think, for automating creativity just to get the work done. But then where does that leave the creative space for humans to create freely? And why is it that robots are the ones that get to be mass creating content right now while working? Artists are underpaid and undervalued for their work right now. So those are things that I like to explore at this time.
Speaker A: Hi, I'm Dave, and I'll try not to be a downer, but I'm kind of a doomer. So I don't really see a world where we get along great with AI and we happen to control and it does things for us that we want it to do. But in that realm, yeah, I get concerned. If we do figure that out somehow, what will you be motivated? I'm very much motivated by doing creative acts and inventing things, creating things. And what will you do instead? I've had some friends say like, oh, it'll be great, I'll just retire and write a book. And I'm like, well, who would read your book? Because there's going to be a way better author writing custom books within a second for the readers. And so I worry about that. Hello, everyone, I'm Matt. I work in this field, so I don't know, I think about this stuff a lot. And I think the two things that I'm thinking about right now is basically like the UX for learning really sucks. And in a lot of schools, it's basically assumed that here's one way to learn, and whoever's best at this one way of learning, which is basically rote fact regurgitation, you get rewarded and everyone else doesn't. It optimizes for your ability to learn in one way. And you get this thing where if you judge a fish by its ability to fly, it'll think it's a failure kind of thing. But I just think that what generative AI does is it distills the essence of information and it can spit it back in whatever format. So if you learn best with a rap song or a poem, or if you're a haiku person, I don't know, you can learn that way. So I'm definitely the anti doomer. I'm like the super optimist about this, just because I think that to the logical extreme, maybe that's where things get messy. But I just think that in the near term, 30, 50 years, you're going to see so many people get these personalized ways of learning that will make them feel really good about something that they were shamed for. I think is going to be cool. And then when I was hearing the other thing, I think you can think about learning and creativity. There's like the utility based stuff. I need to do a thing, I need to submit a thing. But I think if AI gets so good at that, well, then the rest is going to be joy based. I can order food online, but sometimes I cook because it makes me happy. So I think if AI is obviously going to take the cake for utility stuff, well, then we're just more intentional about making space for joy based creativity and learning. So that's where my kind of brain goes, where I think clearly AI is going to win the utility game, but I like to learn and talk to people and walk into mountains with no internet connection. So yeah, I think that's kind of what I'm excited about. Hi, I'm Mike, and I'm just an observer of AI usage and all things articles surrounding the subject, and I've been looking at various sources of people talking about it. Elon Musk, he's talked about recently about what AI may end up helping us to do with stuff like our US election system. And so I think in the States it's particularly important to protect ourselves with our data privacy. It's great that we finally created a piece of legislation called the American Data Privacy and Protection Act. We have a lot more work to do. I know Europe, for example, has had their GDPR privacy mainframe already set up for some years now. So I feel like we're kind of catching up slowly, but we're making some progress and we just have to be very mindful of all aspects of privacy with regard to the usage of AI and especially in the election system. Yeah, I'm Sherwin. I see AI as helping create the best in education. I think of it as work on your left and right brain. So at some point you're trying to figure out what you like to do or what you're good at. So maybe starting when you're younger, getting trained and learning and having AI help with that, I think would be an awesome thing so that you can have your free time and be happy. Cool, thanks. I'm Ryan. I also work in this space and I'm personally super excited about the possibilities. I am doomed, full of some stuff, but with particular education. I think that there's a tremendous amount of opportunity, like many of you have touched on, with accessibility to skill set learning and becoming a master at something, or almost like a tutor or something that previously was impossible, or there's a lot of inequal economic outcomes due to particular resources that someone may have had or opportunities they may have been exposed to, and even the playing field of who. Let's say you want to learn tennis and you have a video that kind of checks your emotions. That's kind of incredible because that can take forever and thousands of dollars of lessons to figure out. If you're an artist, it can teach you the strokes to do and how to mix your paint. And I'm a lawyer. And even legal training. Oftentimes people get pigeonholed into a particular subsection based off of what mentor they found and people are unable to move around. And if there's a way that someone can get trained and verified for a particular field, and obviously the earlier parts and not the download parts, but people can kind of do what they want to do rather than what they, by circumstance, were forced to do.
Speaker B: Hi, everyone, I'm Lisa. I have a couple different thoughts. Is it okay to respond to things other people have said? Is your name Varun? Varun. Something you said reminded me of something someone mentioned to me, which is when typewriters were first introduced, people. Yeah, but it's essentially like people said that it's going to prevent humans from thinking because the typewriter was taking away a lot of the ability for us to think when we're physically writing. People were concerned, and then they said the same thing about calculators. So I definitely think that with AI, there's more of a risk because it's doing more stuff than a typewriter is. But my question and what excites me is what can we do with all this extra time? And it kind of relates to, Andy, what you were saying about creativity as like, if so much of the, I like to call it intellectual manual labor of even stuff that would be conventionally considered creative is taken care of. That gives us so much time to maybe do other things. And one thing, a fun side note, a fun fact I came across recently was that when you're bored, a part of your brain, like some neural pathway that's responsible for making connections between unrelated topics, which is essentially what creativity is, gets activated. But it happens. Like, you have to be bored. You have to be kind of actively, a little bit uncomfortably bored for this to happen. And it's not directly related to AI, but I'm curious how, if we have more time, more space to be bored, to be present, if it'll allow us to be more creative in unexpected ways. Well, I love your synthesis of everything. For me, I'm coming upon this topic from a more personal level. I'm Olivia. I'm someone who's very interested in art and learning, especially learning foreign languages. But before AI, I was never able to break that barrier on my own, to figure out how to learn it in an effective way. But right now, I feel like I could learn anything. And it's gotten to the point where I'm building my own teachers to teach myself foreign languages and to improve my creativity. And I'm so excited about where I can bring all of this. And building on your point as well. I think one thing that I've been thinking about is that knowledge is now so cheap. What used to be valuable society. Like people with advanced degrees, they just have a lot of knowledge in their heads. But now it's gotten to a point where anyone can generate a PhD thesis. Right. I'm thinking about what is the next thing that we need to learn? It was not too long ago that knowing how to read was not something that was expected of everyone. Only a very few small number of people who were in charge of documenting records could read and 99% of the population couldn't. And now 100% of population can. And if even 1% cannot, there's, like, a problem. But what is the next thing that we need to think about? Intentional literacy with AI.
Speaker A: Quick logistical note. So we were thinking about it, and the whole conversation is going so great that we're just going to scrap the break in between and then just keep it going. If you want to grab a drink or anything, I think. Cool. Will we have another discussion group after this, too? No. So this is, like, the whole thing. All right. You're stuck with whoever is around. Thank you, Olivia. Did you want to say anything more? No. Just pass me whatever system you're using to learn a language. I tried to learn German. It's impossible.
Speaker B: I have a prototype I can show you.
Speaker A: Okay. But, yeah, I'm very passionate about the education piece. Like, I had an NGO in the education space for a couple of years think it's super interesting. But the discussion I don't want to get to is, like, some of the questions that we're having. It's like, maybe in 5100 years, we'll not know. We'll know everything. What is there to learn? And I think it's like, we still use calculators. I think someone gave the example here. We still use calculators, we still learn those kind of things. I think we'll still do that a lot. I'm very interested into what can we do now. The tennis systems that we can implement to teach ourselves tennis, which is like one of the use cases, but there are so many, especially, like, the distribution space for people that are not into the education system, that don't even have, like, I don't know, the tennis is kind of an upper class example, but if you want to learn, like, a language or you want to have access to something. But that's the team. I'm pretty interested in space. Cool. What was your name? Jan. Jan. Okay, great. So I've been taking little notes just on what people have been talking about, but if I need to push the discussion, but, like, I'm curious, did something that someone said stick out to anyone just to start it off with? I have a question for the group, but I can forward it in case anyone. Okay, so as we were talking. What's up, Chad? GBT. Yeah. So we're all talking about, are we basically going to make creativity obsolete? What are we going to do after? But in my mind, my take on it is that creativity is just one of those fundamental human desires. So is learning, and likely we're just going to be finding creative ways to express our creativity. I can't foresee a future in which we displace all creativity because it's not like a task we do. It's like a fundamental need I need to be coming up with. I just think it's like a human thing. So from that perspective, I don't know anyone have perspectives on that because I see the fear around work based creativity. But is there even a possibility where humans stop being creative because AI is better? Or do we just like, there's always going to be analog time, right? Unless we do the whole cyborg thing, not down. But I just feel like. I don't know. Do you get my point? I think the question I have is, what is better? Right? If you look at art, for example, there's a lot of art that sells for millions of dollars, and I think it's complete crap, right? So what is better? I think the definition is just going to change over time as the technology changes.
Speaker B: That's just what I personally think. It's going to lead to more innovation because people aren't taking the education system, for example. You're wasting 8 hours of your day, and half of it's just, you're just sitting around not understanding anything, or you already understand it, and you're just sitting there bored. So I feel like taking out all that time, or like going into work, having to do tedious tasks that you could just get done with AI, I feel like that's going to help push out all the things that are super tedious out of your life and give you more time to learn what you want to learn and then also have time to be bored enough to be creative and basically get very innovative. And I feel like that's what's going to push forward, like our existence as a human race even more.
Speaker A: Anyone want to talk?
Speaker B: Yeah. I think people work just way too much. It's like crazy that we work probably more, but on average, like the nine to five, five days a week that was a necessity for when we were in an industrializing society. And we're essentially doing manual labor. And that model continued to work when we essentially did intellectual manual labor. A lot of jobs are probably like 80% or more like intellectual manual labor. If that is all taken care of by AI agents or whatever, what if we worked a lot less? And the rest of the time, I agree that creativity isn't, it can be an act, but it's oftentimes like an impulse. It's just something that happens, and it happens in moments when you don't expect it to. So I think with humans have more time to just do whatever or do nothing, the creativity will still be there. Do you have any thoughts? I think creativity arises out of boredom, time and leisure resource, and maybe even barriers of limitation. So I grew up poor, and I hear a lot from my friends that grew up poor that are like, oh, because we had less, we had to make do with more. And my friends are just so talented and resourceful, instead of paying somebody to fix their sink, they had to YouTube it themselves, and then they know how to fix a sink now. So when it comes to having a tool that brings us such ease to answers, sometimes I worry about the facilitation of creativity versus boredom versus resource limitation. Sometimes the greatest fire under your ass is not having what you need and figuring out with the things that you have what you could solve. So that is a thought for me too. I think all of you guys are talking about leisure time and all that, but with my leisure time, I would take more naps, but with my lack of this or that, I would figure out how to solve a problem.
Speaker A: Equity of voice.
Speaker B: I was a little bit afraid. I think I have the ability to be creative as long as someone is still paying me. But if the AI is taking my job, then I don't have the resources still to be creative, basically. Who will pay me if the AI takes my job?
Speaker A: I think with that, there's some things like, I like woodworking, and it's still rewarding to build a bookshelf that has slight difference in it in style than some other bookshelf, but it's still very much a bookshelf. Some of the beauty in that is like building it yourself. And so even if it was so easy, you could just tell a machine, go build that bookshelf for me, and it would just print it for you. That's, like, less rewarding, but it's somewhat rewarding. You can do more. But I think also going away from, like, just, like, creative, you know, subjective creativity and going towards, like, more innovation as well. I think if we don't have things that bring us all together in businesses, like, okay, Silicon Valley is great for this. I have a great idea. I'm going to start a company, and then, like, 50 people start working really deep on this problem to solve together. If that doesn't really exist, where that kind of innovation gets taken away, where actually instead, just like, 50 computers will go and solve this problem. They already thought of the problem before you did, and there's nothing really left for you to innovate. Will we get together and work as humans together in groups to make things together? I can't think of a lot of artistic or creative products that bring 50 people together, or 100 or thousands. And I think that's a healthy thing to be able to do. There's sort of, like, two interesting things for me here. One of them is that, and I really like your example of wood and stuff. Right. There are machines that can build desks. Right? But there's still something really cool about something that's hand carved and made by a master craftsman. And there are imperfections, and that's partly why we like it and appreciate it. And there's creativity around it using a particular set of tools that is not some machine. And I think that would still be the case with human endeavors. Right. I can totally imagine a world where people are like, someone writes a book that is not assisted by AI, and that is a cool book to read because, you know, it's not assisted by AI. Right? Or think about chess players. Chess is a game that's solved, right? Any move on the board, there is another best move to make, right? And yet they're human beings that sit around spending still most of their days learning about chess, how to best play it, stuff like that. I don't think it would take away all of that necessarily. Can you chip in on your example? Yeah, I think I agree partially. There are two examples that I gave. The first one is the chess player playing, like, himself or herself with someone else. In that case, you were doing this stuff. In the woodcrafting example, you were doing it, and you feel like there's something precious about you doing. But on the other side of the table, getting a book that is not, like, using, I don't think there's that much value. Or buying a different. Or would you pay, like, I don't know, ten times the price, two times the price for a chair that's crafted woodcrafted, I think. Yeah, of course, if you have some resources. Yeah. But I think majority of the population will still get good for the cheaper. So it's like, if it's you that's doing something creative, there is a lot of value in it. But if it's someone else that is doing that without the machine, I don't know, it's not as valuable. Curious. What? Yeah. People think, like, passing the mic. It is like passing the mic. It's kind of cool, right? I mean, it makes sense. So I was thinking about what you said. I guess there's a couple of concepts here. I feel like most people get. They pimp out their creativity to accomplish a goal, and there's this almost ulterior motive. And I think that, again, I need to use my creativity for work to write a freaking document, right. So I think that. Imagine that gets displaced. I think there'd be this uncomfortable friction period where, because I'm creatively burnt out, because my creativity is being pimped out, I wouldn't know what to do with that creativity. But I think that period would then lead to the next phase where you guys know, like, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, right? Well, creativity is really close to actualization. I think that if we take care of our basic human needs, we would get creative about creativity. Like, you like woodworking. If I didn't have to work my job, for whatever reason, I love the idea of building, like, little mini ships in bottles, and I would do that. There are a lot of creative pursuits that I don't have the creative energy left because I'm spending my creativity accomplishing a utility based, capitalistic objective. I would love for that to be taken away so I could save. Everyone has finite brain points per day. I would like to take mine back and work on things that make me more me. I wouldn't be more commoditized, I would be more unique because the creative things I want to work on are different. And I think that one of the reasons I was really excited about this topic is because I think we can use AI to help us all actualize more by removing the shit labor we have to do. If you have 100 brain points in a day and AI can help displace the brain points you have to do to take care of your base needs, well then what else are you going to do with that energy? You're not just going to die, you're going to find a way to use it and you're going to find new creative outlets to really express yourself. And I think it'd be imagine a world where work doesn't need to be done and you introduce yourself by your hobies like, oh, you're a woodworker guy, you're a chess guy, you're an author. It's not like you're judging your output of the authorship against the next best book. I don't care if you're not as good as chess, but you choose that. It's like an expression of self. So that's kind of like what I'm excited about is I just feel like if you have the utility driven creativity displaced, well then you get to use your actual creativity for expressive creativity. To your point about chess, I don't know if you have watched the alpha Zero, like the chess AI stuff, right? Actually, it's not solved. AI is showing us that chess is far from solved. And AI has taken chess to levels that humans could never even imagine. And they keep getting better. They keep getting better. And I think one thing that I kind of don't relate to is that it seems like everybody wants to free up more of their time to do leisure creative stuff that gives them personal enjoyment, right? And what I found is that when Chat GPT was released, I was able to launch my business because my output just went up like crazy, right? So maybe like 100 years from now, 200 years from now, when we have AGI, all our needs are taken care of. That would be the ideal thing. But until then, I have the opportunity to commoditize myself with so much leverage now and personally that excites me just as a capitalist, right? Or whatever. And I agree with that part about unlocking the possibilities based off what you may your productivity going up. I guess I think that, let's say someone owns a corner store and they don't have time for admin, or they need other solutions for inventory or even managing people and there's certain skill sets that giant corporations can rely on analysts for. And if that can be unlocked and teacHing, I guess, or educating people from this village level or a micro level, that can be huge, because I think people do like distinct local things, like whether it's like wood craftsmanship, let's say someone that is a hobbyist and makes certain things, or like an artist that's very talented but doesn't know how to monetize things properly, oftentimes the people that tend to come out on top are the ones that have learned to commercialize. And if you can outsource the non creative part away or whatever part you don't like, because some people may like the business part, and then they don't like the creative part and they can outsource that, I think there's something there.
Speaker B: Sorry. Okay, well, the way I see it, going back to that one point about if all our problems are solved, what are we going to do? Because sometimes a fire under your ass is what drives you to create something, right? I mean, going back to that, the way I see it, we're never going to not have problems. If you look at anybody in the world, even like the person with the most money in the world or the most resources or whatever, you always have problems, and there's always going to be some sort of way to solve it or some sort of way to make it better. And so I think that when we have more time on our hands, or we're not spending as much time doing more tedious things, we're going to figure out ways to use our time to either fire your creativity for leisure, or also to fix other problems you have within your life. If we're talking about going back to the whole having all your basic needs met, I don't think that's going to happen for a really long time. Right. But I think AI is definitely going to help with innovation and figuring out how we can maybe have more of our needs met and just give people more time. And like Sean was saying, more output power to figure out these kinds of problems.
Speaker A: I have a couple of things. One on the more time. I remember when I turned 30, like five of my closest friends retired. They exited startups and they had enough money to live, and they all got really depressed, and it scared the crap out of me. They were like, I can do anything I want now. But they didn't know what to do and they all got really depressed. And I've seen way more people since then go through the same thing. So you're definitely right that it brings more problems. And I see that around all the time. People like crisis, meaning what should I do with my life? And 80 years ago, everyone just had a kid by now at our ages, and we're too busy to really think about that. It was clear what they were supposed to do. It's like raise their kids. So I think that's going to be a thing. But on what you were saying about that brought up more. What I was also trying to point out is, I think by it being easier to outsource the things you don't want to do, it makes it more comfortable and more and more comfortable, which we already have that problem right now. To be isolated and to just work on your own hobby, putting your own bottle ship together, and not working on a big group project. And the shitty parts about work, there's some great parts about, like, I do have to go out there and even though maybe I'm a great boat builder and shipbuilder, but I hate marketing, I hate talking to people. I'm awkward. If I want to be successful, I have to force myself to go out and find somebody who is sociable and who can sell this thing for me and work with them to make it successful as a team. And that forced us to work together as people. And I think that's really valuable. And the more that I sometimes think about this future where everyone's best friend is an AI and it's like overly nice to them and never calls them on their shit, and we all just become spoiled brats and never really can relate to other humans. So I worry that we'll become more and more isolated, which takes away more and more meaning.
Speaker B: I'd like to respond to your point earlier, Matt, about the model shipbuilding. I think it's. And the desire for maybe one day that we live in a world where we just introduce ourselves to our hobbies, and I love that. I wish that was more common here. Yeah. And actually, when I was living in Denmark, that's what people did. People didn't introduce themselves and talk about their jobs. People talked about what they did over the weekend. Yeah, definitely. And a lot of the world is that way. And those countries have thriving economies, and it's often presented as if there's like a zero sum game. We're talking about positive sum games between leisure time and productivity, as if you should use your leisure time to start your own business and do all these great things, which is like an amazing thing to do. But a lot of emerging research is showing that leisure time and working less makes you produce more. And if you have time to do pursue hobies, that may not become your job, could just be something for fun. Maybe this week it's building model ships, maybe next week it's embroidery. Maybe it's whatever you want that actually makes your other time much more productive, too. So I think that's what I'm interested in, how AI can help us become even more productive with less time, but have more joy in the process.
Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with so much of what has been said. And Dave. Right. I think one thing that you've been saying that's really, I think, important is people don't just like learning. We don't just like, that is one of the prime motivations, I think, of a good life. But another thing is we like to feel useful, right? We like to feel important to the world. And you could argue that those are bad desires or those come from a place of lack or something like that, and maybe we should overcome them. But I also think there's something important about feeling like you fit into the world around you and are contributing to it. And in a world where there's so much taken care of, where your skills are not. Even if you're a writer, you're not going to write a book that anyone is going to want to read, because there's always a better book written by an AI that's more fun to read. I feel like there's some tragedy to that. On the other hand, there's so many ways that I can imagine AI helping me contribute to others, right? If I'm in a social space and I'm like, oh, we need someone to repair this thing, or to figure out how this weird piece of technology works, or there's this other person going through this situation that I cannot empathize with. Maybe I can learn or have mock conversations of how to talk to that through an agent. Right. There's so many ways that I feel like we can learn to be useful. I mean, Sean, I think you just mentioned recently how your abilities have been accelerated by. Right. Like, I think that's also true with our ability to be useful to the world around us. So I think it's a bit of both, but I think that's a valid worry for sure. Yeah. I was kind of processing what you said about what's left if you kind of win the game, and if there's no economic incentive to create, why create? And I feel like we don't give humans enough credit. I just think that there's, like, common things about humanity where? Okay, you know who like Burning Man? These people have a lot of money. If you're going to Burning man, you have a level of privilege, and at that point, you're choosing to create meaning by going to this thing. You're collaborating on art. Sure. I think that tech always causes these kind of bumps against the guardrails, like social media, gay people, anxiety, like, all these things. But I just think that then the pendulum swings back, and I do think that if we end up with the loneliness epidemic, well, you know what the number one problem to solve is, then, is loneliness. And you know how people are going to do that is like, wait, we're humans. Loneliness is community. Let's use AI to help bring community together and find hobby groups. Look at what we're doing here, literally. Yeah, we're all technologists, and we're here because of a shared human desire to connect over dialogue. This is like the most ancient thing. This is some caveman shit. And I just think that. I just feel like people end up thinking that humans will forget how to be humans, as if it's a thing you can forget versus it's just programmed into us as, like, a species. Humans want to connect. They want to feel belonging. They want to understand that there's a higher purpose. Creativity feels good. Dopamine. I just think that. I think we compare current state to 10,000 year state and forget that we have the chance to course correct and react to the problems that are coming up in the world right now. I hate to use this example, but as the climate gets worse, more creativity is going to pour into solving the climate crisis. And I think as the loneliness, as people are like, oh, what do I use my creativity for? More people are going to think about how to do that. And I think people are going to band together to address exactly like, the super rich dude, all those depressed entrepreneurs, they can kick it with each other. They could form a support group. But I just think that. But they kind of don't. They kind of don't. And I don't know, it's just like, there are. Sometimes you can solve it with another thing, but when the dynamics aren't right, it's hard to make up for that with artificial or outside incentives. I'm like, solving a lonely epidemic of, like, AI could be like, hey, you three should be best friends. You should be best friends and hang out all the time. And the algorithm has said you should be. And maybe that would work, but I don't know if we work like that. I think it has to work a little bit more organically. We have to have reasons for working with each other and hanging out with each other, and maybe the AI can come up with those, but I think we have to have reasons to do what we're going to do.
Speaker B: I'd like to add some food for thought that maybe some of you know this. While there's Maslow's hierarchy of needs, where the top is self actualization, there's an indigenous framework of actualization, where the self actualization is actually at the bottom of the indigenous pyramid, and community actualization is the top. So I just wanted to add that in for everybody who's talking about, just like, the deification of the individual experience, maybe once that is solved, we just get depressed. Unless we look to each other and.
Speaker A: Help each other, it's, like, way too relevant. It's a super quick thing. What people don't know is that before Maslow died, there was, like, a revised version of his hierarchy of needs where the actualization at the top is outdated. Before he died, what's above actualization is self transcendence. It's caring about more than oneself. And a lot of cultures converge on this. Call it Nirvana, call it a feeling of oneness, but literally, the notion of Maslow's hierarchy with actualizations at the top, that's just because the triangle is already made. You can't have another thing on top of the point. But Mazzo, actually his highest thing was self transcendence, which is kind of in line, which is. I mean, I've made my point of, like, I think that people will have a period of despair, but I trust the human spirit to bounce back. And I think every depressed entrepreneur will be in a bad state for a while, but then they'll find something, because that's a human spirit, is my take. And I think that as everyone actualizes, we're going to start thinking more about the collective. That's. Yeah, I just wanted to add that also, I think being depressed is part of being happy, right? So maybe this is what humanity needed. We needed to go into social media. We needed to go into our rabbit holes, perform as high as we can at an individual level, just to realize that, oh, there is another thing. And then by then, we have the data infrastructure to communicate at scale. It doesn't have to be doom and gloom. His business goes right. This topic reminds me of, has anybody here read the book player piano by Kurt Vonnegut? It's a really interesting concept that's super relevant today in this discussion. And it was like a future world he describes where everyone keeps inventing things and inventing, inventing, and everyone gets out of the job until there's like a point where there's only like 300 scientists anymore that have any jobs because everything else has been automated and it's following this one scientist and his job is about to get automated, and there's only going to be like 50 people left with jobs. And everybody else is like, they just sit around. It doesn't even really describe what they do, but they're not happy. They don't have anything to do. And then something happens and some revolt happens and they blow up the systems and they have to really restart from zero. And right away people are excited by this. They're like celebrating, but right away they start like, oh, they start fixing things. They're like, oh, we should reinvent that to do this. And they just kind of restart over inventing everything again, but they were excitedly doing it, but going toward that same future again. And I think it's like a book that is really about this topic of innovation. We can't help ourselves, but to innovate ourselves out of the job. Did we convert the doomer? No. I mean, I'm a doomer because I think it's going to kill us all. And then this is all kind of like, I don't know. Yeah, reasonable. Just for fun. We're dead before we get to this point. The one thing that came to mind is that I think we were talking about the personalization of books or, like, content. Humans do have a desire to connect with someone, like you made the example of, oh, have you heard of this book? Or they talk with their friends about Game of Thrones or whatever show or content there is. So I don't think that personalized content will be as attractive as people think it will be to humans. I think that people do, like, sharing things and watch parties and things like that. Otherwise they could watch video game recalls, I guess, or something like that for a sports team, rather than watch an NFL game and congregate around most sports or American Idol. Yeah, it's like nobody actually likes American Idol that everyone talks about. Yeah, I think you're right. Pop culture. What about this side of the table? We haven't heard from you all in a bit. I'm not going to do that, actually. That's actually something I never thought about before, seriously. Like, the idea of you're not going to like personalized music, which is something a lot of people are very big on, or gaming in the example, because you just want to send their favorite album to your friends. That's the only comment I have, but related? Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, maybe one day, universal income, everything we, you know, everyone will be able to create something and connect with each other a little easier. Sorry. Yeah, I'd say. I think resources wise, if we don't worry about that and just stick with what we like to do and help each other, that's probably part of the whole actualization and community thing that will help us in the end. I thought you had your hands. All right, crazy idea. What if in schools in the future they taught and focused on social skills, not anything utility driven, because at the end of the day, at a certain point, the existential threat will be like loneliness and social skills. And what if it became like we're going to. You'll figure it out along the way. Like the same way. Just Wikipedia, Google it. You'll figure out how to do algebra. Hopefully we get rid of that too. But yeah, what if school was just like a social thing? Still a Catholic school can't speak to that. But yeah, I don't know. Humans are weird, man. Humans are ridiculous little critters. And I just think that as the need for. Why do you go to. Okay, I'm an immigrant kid. You go to school so you can get a good job, so you could blah, blah, blah. But it all is like a capitalist thing. So say that goes away. What do we do with our children? I would seriously, I like the argument of if I were to send my kid, okay, I don't have a kid, but I'm like, I'm going to send him to public school so he can get pushed around and figure out his identity and blah, blah, blah, I don't give a shit what he learns. And what if that's kind of what the future looks like, where it's basically like, we teach our kids to be human, not to teach stuff that's going to be obsolete because that just feels like where this is. There's going to be a point where the utility thing doesn't make as much sense. And it's like, okay, use those impressionable periods to develop human skills, like emotional resilience and intelligence and social stuff and figure out who you are. Learn how to like, whatever. That could be a thing. No, go ahead. I think very little actually is of what we learn. Let's say up until college we actually know very specialized skills. But like elementary, high school, in my view, it's very like the building blocks of understanding society and where we live. Even if you're learning biology and you're learning very specific. Oh, that's how to classify animals. We understand basic differences of our environment and that's important. And I agree. Maybe you'll not learn through the book. Maybe you'll learn something else with an agent or specialized target explanation to you. But I think you'll still have to understand that concept. Algebra. I don't think you'll ever be able to just understand algebra when you need it. You'll have basing building blocks of math and then understanding what algorithms are to a basic understanding. And then maybe the college education and more specialized jobs will be more into the philosophy or concepts, concepts of discussing what we're discussing here and not discussing specific algorithms or engineering skills, for example. But up until there, like the basic creation, up until you are out of the hood, I think it's going to be pretty much the same. Or my view. Go ahead. Yeah. On this point, there's a lot of stuff that we learn today in school that is kind of useless if you think about it. We live in a world where you can type everything. What's the point of learning how to write by hand, for example? Right? Or we live in a world, maybe that one is a little bit more contrived. I am right. But I guess another one is with a calculator, right? You can do all your math. I do a lot of my math on my phone. And yet I had to learn how to do complicated mental math when I was growing up and how to add numbers by hand in all these complicated ways. Whatever, right? I don't know, looking back on it, whether that was important for me to learn or not, but I'm wondering if anyone else feels like those were useful things or whether they would have been better off. Just like being taught how to use a calculator. Well, and end of story. I was just going to say, I think chat GPT is already like a better teacher than most teachers out there. I feel like if I had chat GPT when I was in 6th, 7th, 8th grade, I would have actually taken an interest in math and stuff if I didn't just get stuck with my terrible middle school teacher. So as much as I agree with you, or as interesting as it is to look into the future of what school will be like and why people would choose to send their kids to school in the future, but look at today, I would argue that's pretty much what kids are getting out of school today is the social stuff. It's not what they're getting in the classrooms, it's getting bullied or it's fucking whatever it is that they're doing, that's what they're learning from it, like from the classroom. You already have a way superior teacher already.
Speaker B: You can go ahead. Okay. Well, I mean, going back to what you were saying, I feel like obviously we do stuff on our calculators or we do things in a much easier way than how we learn to do them at school. But I think the reason that it's important to learn some of those things, I don't agree with most of the stuff they teach at school, but I feel like some of the things, it's like for your motor skills or to develop that thought process and those thinking patterns and understanding how it works, not that you can do it, but understanding that it works like that. So I feel like education could possibly be revolutionized to kind of learn more concepts and learn the applications of concepts rather than just rote memorization, just not understanding what's happening and just memorizing it, which I think they do a lot at school still. Okay. I do think it is important to know how to do basic algebra and division and addition. I feel like it is not so much that we can type press numbers, but that we know at a conceptual level what it's doing so that we can split money equally, we can add stuff, we can do our taxes and stuff like that. And to your point, even right now, I have a friend who is a math teacher in high school, and he says that the kids are taking pictures of their math problems and getting it solved automatically. So they can't even do algebra at 18. They can't move a number across the equation sign and figure out what that does to the number. And I think that's actually pretty dangerous.
Speaker A: I also agree with the danger of that, and I think that there are certain critical thinking skills that you gain through problem solving, and you can take a picture of something. How are you going to be able to do prompt engineering of some sort, like prompt anything? You're not going to be able to use the tools at your disposal. It's like having a machine, but you can't figure out how to make it work. So the McFlurry won't be made forever. In the name of giving humans more credit. You know what the best professors are doing is? They're teaching people to work with AI and the writing professors who are like, write this essay. Now, the assignment is have Chad GPT make two essays and compare them. So, yeah, I just think that people are going to just push creative thinking and these almost fundamental skills of problem solving. How do you structure an idea? How do you communicate? How do you evaluate things? Because it's almost like there's teachers who are resisting it and whatnot. But I just think it's up to us to figure out how do you design the next step, given the circumstance? Because the circumstances that a lot of this rote stuff, it's done. It's crazy that it still feels so surreal that Chad GBT, it's, like, nuts. It's boggling my mind. But now there's a lot of conversations resisting it. But I feel like the people pushing society forward are, like, cool. So let's use our good old brains and figure out what do we do, given the fact. And I think that's really cool. Okay. I have a lot of thoughts of it. Okay. Aya.
